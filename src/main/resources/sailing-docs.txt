Chilean navy searching for American solo sailor adrift on disabled yacht
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SANTIAGO, Chile 2007-01-03 19:00:27 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chilean navy has launched a search-and-rescue operation for a Southern
California sailor adrift off the tip of South America while trying to
circumnavigate the globe, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ken Barnes, 47, of Newport Beach, California, set off from Long Beach on Oct. 28
in a 44-foot catch called the Privateer in hopes of sailing around the world.
His longtime girlfriend, Cathy Chambers, said he called her Tuesday on his
satellite phone to say he was in trouble.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Coast Guard and Chilean maritime officials also picked up signals from
Barnes' distress beacon Tuesday afternoon and believe he is about 500 miles (800
kilometers) off the Pacific coast of Chile.
</P>
<P>
Barnes told Chambers he had lost engine power and steering and had two broken
masts and broken hatches, she said. The Privateer was also taking on water in
40-knot winds and 25-foot (7.6-meter) swells, he reported.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning, a Chilean navy search aircraft flew over the area where
the Barnes' disabled yacht is believed to be, but clouds and rain kept the plane
from spotting the yacht, navy press officer Paula Paredes said by telephone from
Punta Arenas, 3,200 kilometers (1,990 miles) south of the capital of
Santiago.
</P>
<P>
Weather conditions in the area were expected to improve by Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Paredes said the navy also dispatched a tugboat to the western entry to the
straits of Magellan on the tip of South America, and ordered a trawler and a
merchant boat already there to join the search. None of the boats was expected
to reach Barnes before the weekend, however.
</P>
<P>
Paredes said Barnes "is alive and well and keeping satellite telephone contact
with relatives in California."
</P>
<P>
According to Barnes' Web site, he "continue(d) to ride out the storm with
disabled Privateer" on Wednesday and anticipated that the Chilean navy would
drop communication and support equipment to him.
</P>
<P>
Chambers said Barnes has called her several times since, for no more than a
minute each time. He last called around 5 a.m. PST (1300 GMT) Wednesday, she
said.
</P>
<P>
"We need someone out there right away to get to him. He has supplies but I don't
know how many of them are good and how many aren't because now there's water in
the boat," said Chambers, who was keeping vigil in the couple's Newport Beach
home with Barnes' family.
</P>
<P>
Barnes first reported his emergency to the U.S. Coast Guard, which contacted the
Chilean navy.
</P>
<P>
"I do know from reviewing his Web site that he was well-equipped for the journey
he was making. He had all the survival gear on board," said Coast Guard
spokesman Lt. Tim McGhee.
</P>
<P>
On his Web site, Barnes wrote that he planned his trip for several
years.
</P>
<P>
"For many years, probably from the age of 10, I have liked the solitude of
sailing, the adventure, the adrenaline associated with the chance encounter of
the unknown," he said.

Malaysia denies cracking down on Islamic newspaper over Michelle Yeoh photo
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia 2007-01-04 09:24:10 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Malaysian authorities have seized from newsstands copies of a tabloid newspaper
run by an opposition Islamic party, but denied the move was sparked by the
publication of a photograph that shows the prime minister at a public event with
actress Michelle Yeoh.
</P>
<P>
The latest issue of Harakah features a front page photograph of Prime Minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi placing a hand on Yeoh's bare shoulder during a dinner
ceremony at an international sailing tournament in Malaysia's northeastern
Terengganu state last month.
</P>
<P>
Officers from the Internal Security Ministry have confiscated copies from retail
outlets over the past week because the newspaper is supposed to be sold only to
members of the opposition Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party, the ministry's
enforcement spokesman, Zailani Hashim, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The action has nothing to do with images published in the issue," Zailani said,
rejecting speculation by Harakah's editor that the government wants to prevent
the photo from being seen.
</P>
<P>
Harakah's Web site said the photograph displayed Abdullah's "naughty antics"
with Yeoh, a Malaysian-born star whose international film credits include
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and the James Bond film, "Tomorrow Never
Dies."
</P>
<P>
The Islamic party that publishes Harakah has often accused Abdullah's moderate
government of failing to uphold religious and moral standards in this Southeast
Asian country, where nearly two-thirds of the 26 million people are ethnic Malay
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
The party is the main political rival of Abdullah's ruling coalition and
publishes 140,000 copies of Harakah twice a month. The newspaper's
government-approved publication license states it can only be sold to party
members, but the rule is often not stringently enforced.
</P>
<P>
Fewer than 100 copies have been seized from outlets in Malaysia's main city,
Kuala Lumpur, Zailani said. He added that the government has the right to
retract the newspaper's permit because it was violating its conditions, but no
such action is being planned so far.
</P>
<P>
Harakah's editor, Ahmad Lutfi Othman, said the permit's conditions were unfair.
He noted that copies had sometimes been confiscated from public outlets between
1999 and 2000, but that this was the first such incident since he became editor
last February.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the government is now trying to create a culture of fear through
these raids," Ahmad Lutfi said. "We're studying this matter with plans to
challenge the regulations in court."
</P>
<P>
International and local rights groups have long criticized restrictions on press
freedoms in Malaysia, where the government is closely linked with the mainstream
media and wields tough laws that require publishers to obtain annual permits
from authorities.

SAILING: British teen lands in Antigua after record-breaking solo sail across
Atlantic
</P>
<P>
ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) -- A British teenager became the youngest person to sail
solo across the Atlantic Ocean on Wednesday, reaching the Caribbean island of
Antigua after a six-week voyage.
</P>
<P>
Mike Perham, 14, raised his fist triumphantly to a crowd of Antiguan officials
and supporters as he docked outside St. John's on the southeastern side of the
island.
</P>
<P>
Perham said he was lonely at times but not afraid as he made the crossing in the
Cheeky Monkey, his 28-foot (8.5-meter) sailboat. He helped pass the time by
studying and chatting on a satellite phone.
</P>
<P>
"It has been a fantastic journey," he said.
</P>
<P>
Perham, who was trailed by his father in another boat, set sail Nov. 18 from
Gibraltar and made brief stops to replace satellite phones in the Canary Islands
and Cape Verde. They were originally expected to complete the 3,500-mile
(5600-kilometer) trip just before Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
Perham's father, Peter, praised his son's courage and tenacity.
</P>
<P>
"At home in England you can't even climb a tree without a safety certificate, so
I hope it will ignite a little spark in some families," he told reporters. "When
a child puts their mind to really want to do something they should be thoroughly
supported."

Origin marks return of Britain to America ' s Cup
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON 2007-01-04 13:40:57 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Britain will race in the America's Cup again after the launch of Origin on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Keith Mills, former chief executive of the London 2012 bid committee, will
spearhead Britain's effort to bring the Auld Mug to Britain for the first time
in the competition's 155-year history.
</P>
<P>
"This is the only major sporting trophy in this country that we have never won,"
Mills said. "My aim is to build a team capable of finally winning this elusive
trophy, and in doing so, win the right to host the America's Cup back on British
shores for the first time in over 150 years."
</P>
<P>
Britain hosted the first race off the English coast in 1851, when the New
York-owned schooner America beat the host's Aurora.
</P>
<P>
Origin will enter the 33rd and 34th America's Cup races. The 32nd America's Cup
will be held in Valencia, Spain, from June 23-July 7.
</P>
<P>
"We need to be ready to go as soon as this cup ends," Mills said. "Because the
next cup cycle is likely to be quick, we need the time between now and July to
nail down key people."
</P>
<P>
Mills said there had been "significant" discussions with designers and sponsors
in the past 10-12 months. Yachtsmen will be signed up immediately after the
America's Cup final in July, with talks already under way with crewman who are
under contract with other teams.
</P>
<P>
A first boat will be launched in 2008, with the launch of the second scheduled
for 2009. Origin will have an annual budget of euro30 million ($39 million),
with Mills looking to attract up to three major sponsors and finalize an
agreement with a yacht club by June.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to finish in the top three or four teams in the first challenge
realistically, and then be in a position to win the cup in the 34th challenge,"
Mills said.
</P>
<P>
Royal Yachting Association chief executive Rod Carr said it's the right time to
launch an entry since British sailing has "never been as successful as it is
today."
</P>
<P>
"In my view, there are three peaks in competitive racing," Carr said. "Britain
has already scaled the heights in the Olympic and offshore arena, and I believe
we have the talent and expertise to create a winning America's Cup
team."
</P>
<P>
Britain has won 10 sailing medals -- including five golds -- in the past two
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The last British entry -- GBR Challenge -- lost in the Louis Vuitton Cup
challenger series quarterfinals at the 31st America's Cup. Sovereign was the
last British yacht to reach the America's Cup final in 1964, losing 4-0 to
American boat Constellation.
</P>
<P>
Swiss boat Alinghi, the defending champion, is the only European team to have
won the oldest trophy in sport.
</P>
<P>
Mills is a non-executive director of Tottenham football club and remains
involved with London 2012 Games as a non-executive deputy chairman.

<TEXT>
<P>
A Portuguese man was missing and presumed dead after falling from a yacht that
he and a friend were sailing from Antigua to Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
Luiz Santos, 36, went overboard while fixing a sail on the 42-foot (13-meter)
Wendy during a storm on Dec. 29, skipper Alvaro Conbe said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A two-day search involving two U.S. Coast Guard aircraft and three merchant
ships was called off after finding no sign of Santos, according to the Bermuda
Maritime Operations Center.
</P>
<P>
Conbe, a 29-year-old Spaniard, said he threw a flotation device to Santos but
after turning the boat around, he could not find the man in the rough water
about 350 miles (560 kilometers) southeast of Bermuda. Conbe arrived in Bermuda

Navy aircraft spots American sailor adrift off Chilean coast, trawler sailing for rescue
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SANTIAGO, Chile 2007-01-04 17:42:18 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Chilean navy search plane has located an American solo sailor on his disabled
yacht off the southern tip of South America, the navy reported, but the U.S.
Embassy said he probably could not be rescued until Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The navy said in a brief written statement that a trawler was sailing to rescue
the Southern California sailor, Ken Barnes, who on Wednesday lost contact with
friends when the battery of his satellite telephone ran down.
</P>
<P>
Barnes, 47, had planned to sail around the world when he set off from Long Beach
on Oct. 28 in his 44-foot ketch.
</P>
<P>
He was wearing a survival suit and didn't appear to be in immediate danger,
according to his girlfriend, Cathy Chambers, who had been in contact with him by
telephone.
</P>
<P>
The navy did not say when the trawler Polar Pesca 1 was expected to reach
Barnes' yacht Privateer, but it was about 500 kilometers (295 miles) away when
the navy plane spotted the yacht on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy, Judith Baroody, said it probably would not
reach Barnes before Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Baroody said the embassy had been in contact both with Barnes' family and with
Chilean authorities and has "full confidence" in the capacity of Chilean
authorities to handle the emergency.
</P>
<P>
One of the pilots of the aircraft, Capt. Gonzalo Vasquez, told the Chilean state
television that Privateer was not in danger of sinking.
</P>
<P>
The other pilot, Capt. Cesar Delgado, added that "we will continue to fly,
keeping watch on the yacht, so we can support the boats now sailing toward it
with information."
</P>
<P>
The navy said that the 12-meter (40-foot) waves and strong winds that disabled
the Privateer had abated and weather conditions had improved greatly so that
officials expect "excellent conditions to allow the ships in the area of the
emergency to reach (Barnes) as soon as possible to rescue him."
</P>
<P>
In addition to the trawler, the navy tugboat Leucoton, which has a helicopter,
and a merchant boat from Malta that were operating in the area were also ordered
to join the rescue effort near the western entry to the Straits of
Magellan.
</P>
<P>
Chambers said in Newport Beach, California, that she received a satellite phone
from the sailor at 5:26 p.m. PST (0126 GMT) Wednesday in which he said that
would probably be his last because the telephone phone had run out of
battery.
</P>
<P>
Until then, Barnes had kept frequent telephone contact with her. He had also
contacted officials and used the phone on Tuesday to first report that the storm
had disabled his boat.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Coast Guard and Chilean maritime officials picked up signals from his
distress beacon Tuesday afternoon, when he was believed to be about 500 miles
off the Pacific coast.
</P>
<P>
After getting the call Wednesday evening, Chambers said Barnes "is shaky,
scared, but I think he's hopeful now that he's seen the plane and he knows
they've located him."
</P>
<P>
Chambers said Barnes "has supplies but I don't know how many of them are good
and how many aren't because now there's water in the boat."

North Korea ship detained for safety violations leaves Hong Kong port
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HONG KONG 2007-01-05 05:18:06 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A North Korean cargo ship was sailing home Friday after being stranded in Hong
Kong for two months waiting for its cash-strapped country to send money to fix
equipment that violated safety regulations.
</P>
<P>
The Kang Nam 5 left its moorings on Thursday night after its owners finally paid
for the repairs to its lifesaving, communications and emergency lighting
equipment, said the ship's local agent, Topping Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The vessel's inspection papers and navigational charts were also deemed
insufficient after the ship arrived without cargo on Oct. 25 from the southern
Taiwanese port of Kaohsiung. Topping said the vessel usually hauls scrap
metal.
</P>
<P>
There was much speculation that Hong Kong's move was in response to new U.N.
sanctions ordering the inspection of North Korean ships -- measures imposed after
North Korea's Oct. 9 nuclear test.
</P>
<P>
But Hong Kong officials insisted that the inspection was routine and unrelated
to the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
A Topping spokesman, who only gave his surname, Wong, said the ship was sailing
to North Korea's western port of Nampo. It planned to stop to refuel in the port
of Lianyungang in the eastern Chinese province of Jiangsu, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"It may take up to three or four days to sail to Jiangsu because of bad weather.
The vessel is expected to arrive home in about one week," Wong
said.
</P>
<P>
Wong said ships are often detained in Hong Kong for safety checks, but a cargo
vessel has never been held for such a long time.
</P>
<P>
"It may be due to their funding problems. And North Korean ships are less likely
to comply with safety measures than the others," he said.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported the ship's repair bill was about US$30,000 (euro22,890),
with an additional US$5,000 (euro3,815) for anchorage fees.
</P>
<P>
The ship will return without its scrap metal cargo because the Hong Kong company
that was supposed to consign the shipment had canceled due to the delay, Wong
said.
</P>
<P>
The Kang Nam 5 was the second vessel to be detained for safety violations in
Hong Kong since the U.N. sanctions were imposed. The first ship, Kang Nam I, was
held on Oct. 22, but was released 13 days later after complying with safety
regulations.

American sailor rescued after 3 days adrift at sea
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PUNTA ARENAS, Chile 2007-01-05 14:00:12 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An American sailor was rescued early Friday after three days adrift on a
disabled yacht in treacherous seas off the southern tip of South America, the
Chilean navy said.
</P>
<P>
Ken Barnes, 47, was picked up shortly before 8 a.m. (1100GMT) by the Chilean
trawler Polar Pesca 1, the navy's Operations Department reported in Punta
Arenas, on Chile's southwestern tip.
</P>
<P>
An officer, who asked not to be identified in line with the department's rules,
said by telephone that Barnes was in good condition except for a small wound in
his right thigh.
</P>
<P>
Relatives hugged and cried in joy as word of his rescue reached the Newport
Beach, California, condominium where they had gathered.
</P>
<P>
Barnes' 21-year-old twin daughters, his longtime girlfriend and his mother
huddled around the cell phone, trying to make out his words over a broken
connection that lasted less than 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"I love you. I'm on the fishing boat headed for Punta Arenas and I'm OK and
everything's OK," he said in a calm voice. "I should be there in a day or
two."
</P>
<P>
Barnes' mother, June Dee Linn, broke into tears upon hearing he had been
rescued. "I'm just picturing him on the ship and being grateful that he's been
picked up," she said.
</P>
<P>
The trawler was guided to the disabled yacht by a navy plane. Pilots first
spotted a flare, then saw the American sailor, who was wearing a yellow jacket
and waving.
</P>
<P>
The trawler sent four men on an inflatable boat to pick up the
sailor.
</P>
<P>
"Once onboard the trawler, he contacted us by radio," said pilot Capt. Cesar
Delgado. "He said he was well, except for a minor cut on his right thigh. And he
repeatedly thanked the Chilean navy for its help."
</P>
<P>
Barnes' attempt to sail nonstop around the world was interrupted when his
44-foot ketch hit a storm that broke both its masts and soaked the sailor's
supplies and food. The ketch also lost its engine power.
</P>
<P>
Barnes set off from Long Beach, California, on Oct. 28.
</P>
<P>
The navy officer said he would be taken to Punta Arenas, a trip that could take
up to two days.
</P>
<P>
Delgado said the duration of the trip will depend mainly on the wind, "which
changes here virtually every 12 hours and sometimes is very, very strong, making
sailing very slow."
</P>
<P>
Barnes's ketch Privateer had been spotted early Wednesday by one of two planes
sent by the navy from central Chile. The planes continued flying over the area
to help guide the trawler, had been about 295 miles (475 kilometers)
away.
</P>
<P>
The Privateer had been disabled by strong winds and 40-foot (12-meter) waves as
it sailed near the tip of South America. Weather conditions have since improved
in the area, according to the navy.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Coast Guard and Chilean maritime officials picked up signals from
Barnes' distress beacon Tuesday afternoon, when he was believed to be about 500
miles (800 kilometers) off the Pacific coast, at the western entry to the
Straits of Magellan.
</P>
<P>
Pictures of the disabled vessel, taken by a search plane, were posted on the
family's Web site.
</P>
<P>
Barnes had planned his trip for several years, his Web site said.
</P>
<P>
"For many years, probably from the age of 10, I have liked the solitude of
sailing, the adventure, the adrenaline associated with the chance encounter of
the unknown," he said.
</P>
<P>
His girlfriend, Cathy Chambers, said she had supported Barnes' dream to sail
around the world, but had now changed her mind.
</P>
<P>
"He attempted it, he tried it, but after what I know now -- no way! His life is
too important," she said.

Pan Am officials disapprove changes at sailing venue
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil 2007-02-03 14:37:25 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pan American Games officials have not accepted the proposed construction changes
at the competition's sailing venue, putting the boating event in jeopardy five
months before the Games.
</P>
<P>
A judicial dispute between a government entity and the Rio de Janeiro Pan
American Games Organizing Committee has stalled construction at the venue, and
the proposal to build temporary installations was disapproved by officials from
the Pan American Sports Organization, or PASO.
</P>
<P>
"It does not accept the organizing committee's proposal to modify the original
project," members of the organization said in a statement released Friday after
a three-day visit to Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
The organization said the modifications would be prejudicial to the event, and
because of the "seriousness of the situation," it decided to relay the findings
for an analysis by PASO president Mario Vazquez Rana.
</P>
<P>
"If the president doesn't authorize the venue to be used, there's a risk the
sailing competition will not take place," Julio Cesar Maglione, president of
PASO's coordinating committee, told the local sports daily Lance. "And
unfortunately, without Olympic standards for sailing, Rio's bid for 2016 becomes
impossible."
</P>
<P>
Rio de Janeiro is a pre-candidate to host the 2016 Olympics, and the July 13-29
Pan American Games are seen as a test for the city.
</P>
<P>
Construction at the sailing venue stopped in December because of court orders
won by a government entity in charge of national patrimony. It claimed permanent
changes at the national park chosen for the event were not allowed.
</P>
<P>
There was no timetable for a final judicial decision.
</P>
<P>
The officials visiting Rio de Janeiro praised the overall preparation for the
Games, and said the only other topic that needed to be addressed was the
infrastructure around the Pan American Village, especially because of poor road
access to the buildings.
</P>
<P>
"We are very pleased seeing how the construction sites are developing," Maglione
said. "They are at an extraordinary level."

Members of the Pan American Sports Organization, or PASO, last week disapproved
the proposal to build provisional installations. On Thursday, PASO president
Mario Vazquez Rana said the organization reconsidered its decision and would
make an exception.
</P>
<P>
"PASO decided to exceptionally approve the (alternate) project," Rana said in a
statement. "This decision is fundamental to guarantee the sailing competition in
the Games and protect the interests and expectations of the sport's
athletes."
</P>
<P>
Construction at the sailing venue stopped in December because of court orders
won by a government body in charge of national patrimony. It claimed permanent
changes at the national park chosen for the event were not allowed.
</P>
<P>
The Games' organizing committee said the construction of temporary installations
was the only alternative to guarantee the sailing competition.
</P>
<P>
Rana said the original project must be restarted if a final judicial decision in
favor of the organizing committee is reached. There was no timetable for the
decision.
</P>
<P>
"The original project would leave a legacy for Brazil's Olympic sports and would
be a matter of pride for the Pan American Games," Rana said.
</P>
<P>
Rio de Janeiro is a pre-candidate to host the 2016 Olympics, and the Pan
American Games are seen as a test for the city.

Coutts and Cayard launch sailing series
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WELLINGTON, New Zealand 2007-02-09 11:49:57 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American sailor Paul Cayard joined New Zealander Russell Coutts and Portuguese
promoter Joao Lagos on Friday to launch the World Sailing League, an annual
global racing series with a US$2 million winner's check.
</P>
<P>
The series, in which 12 national teams will race 22-meter (70-foot) catamarans
on a circuit running up to eight months -- drawing elements from Olympic sailing
and Formula One motor racing -- will debut in 2009, Cayard was scheduled to tell
a news conference in Lisbon, Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Cayard said he and Coutts -- both former Olympians, world champions and America's
Cup-winning helmsmen -- had developed the concept into a competitive
reality.
</P>
<P>
"This project has been three years in the planning," said Cayard. "We've worked
together on the concept over that period with different phases of
intensity."
</P>
<P>
The series will follow F1's example of having a set, global calendar with racing
taking place at a wide range of venues in North and South America, northern
Europe, the Mediterranean, the Middle East and Asia.
</P>
<P>
It will have the nationalism which is the keynote of the Olympics, Cayard
said.
</P>
<P>
Racing would be held close to shore, to enhance spectator involvement, and while
fleet races among 12 teams are envisaged, time trials and slalom racing might
also be featured.
</P>
<P>
Cayard said he and Coutts would have input into the designs of the catamarans
along with a team including leading designers Marc Van Peteghem and Lauriot
Prévost. Coutts and Cayard would oversee design work, the launch of a prototype
around the end of 2007 and the construction of a fleet of one-design yachts for
use in the inaugural series.
</P>
<P>
After establishing a class rule and putting in place additional technical and
official framework for the series, the pair would then concentrate on their
roles as competitors, lending headline names to the series in its formative
seasons.
</P>
<P>
Cayard said he, Coutts and Lagos had already had numerous expressions of
interest from potential competitors, drawn from a wide range of sailing
disciplines. The World Sailing League offered a career path and professional
opportunity to sailors from Olympic class, keeler, monohull and multihull
backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
"Russell, João Lagos and I are pooling our experiences from the America's Cup,
the Olympic Games and a multitude of other sporting competitions," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We have taken the best ideas from sports events all over the world and added
innovative concepts to generate an exciting new series that will maximise the
appeal to sailors, sponsors and spectators.
</P>
<P>
"For a venture like this, it was also important that the(International Sailing
Federation) support the concept and they have confirmed they are fully behind
us."

Police briefly detain 2 men suspected of planning to hijack Istanbul ferry
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ANKARA, Turkey 2007-02-10 13:09:15 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police detained two men Saturday on suspicions that they were planning to hold
up an Istanbul ferry to protest the fact that pro-Armenian slogans had been
chanted at a slain journalist's funeral, police said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
An Istanbul court ordered the two men released after questioning, saying there
was not enough evidence to charge them.
</P>
<P>
Acting on a tip, police detained the two men at the city's entrance Saturday, a
police official said. He spoke on condition of anonymity because of rules that
bar civil servants from speaking to reporters without prior authorization.
</P>
<P>
Police said the two men -- from the eastern city of Igdir, near the borders with
Iran and Armenia -- allegedly planned to hijack a ferry sailing between the Asian
and European shores of the Bosporous, copying a ferry hijacking last month in
the Dardanelles strait, police said.
</P>
<P>
That hijacker had threatened to blow the ferry up in protesting the pro-American
slogans. He had been carrying a gun, but no explosives, and after about 2 1/2
hours surrendered to police. No passengers were harmed.
</P>
<P>
As the two men detained Saturday left the courthouse, they shouted: "Turks have
no other friends but Turks!" the state-run Anatolia news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Armenian journalist Hrant Dink, who spoke out about the mass killings of
Armenians in the early 20th century, was gunned down outside his newspaper in
Istanbul on Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
Dink had been brought to trial numerous times for allegedly "insulting
Turkishness," a crime under an article in the country's penal
code.
</P>
<P>
His funeral inspired a massive outpouring of support for reconciliation between
Armenians and Turks, with thousands chanting "We're all Armenians." Nationalists
however, were angered by the pro-Armenian slogans.

Hawaiian canoes make first landfall after long journey
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MAJURO, Marshall Islands 2007-02-19 21:18:26 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After traveling 2,200 miles across the Pacific and weathering several storms,
two voyaging canoes from Hawaii have arrived at their first destination.
</P>
<P>
The Hokulea and Alingano Maisu canoes made landfall in the lagoon of Majuro
Atoll on Sunday night. Crew members first sighted the tops of coconut trees
earlier in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The initial leg of the journey took 26 days.
</P>
<P>
"They're all smiles," said Maisu spokeswoman Pomai Bertelmann, who was aboard a
tour boat that met the canoes.
</P>
<P>
The crews were healthy but tired after paddling for nearly a month, she
said.
</P>
<P>
The international trip is being made to honor renowned navigator Mau Piailug of
Satawal, who taught Pacific way-finding to Native Hawaiians. The Maisu will be
presented to Piailug as a gift.
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, Piailug taught modern Hawaiians the ancient Polynesian art of
noninstrument navigation, which had been lost for centuries in the
islands.
</P>
<P>
"I'm so thrilled inside. I feel like crying," said Kawika Eskaran, one of the
builders of the Maisu. "I'm just glad they are safe."
</P>
<P>
The canoe crews plan to restock their vessels and rest before sailing to Majuro
for their first welcoming ceremony, which will include Marshall Islands
President Kesai Note.
</P>
<P>
Afterward, the vessels will sail west to Ponape, Chuuk, Pulawat and Satawal.
From there they head to Woleai, Ulithi and Yap, then to the Republic of Palau in
mid-March to complete the Micronesian trip.
</P>
<P>
The next part of their travels leads to Japan from March through May -- to honor
King David Kalakaua for his role in opening doors to Japanese migration in
1885.
</P>
<P>
The Hokulea will sail from Palau to Okinawa, Kumamoto, Nagasaki, Fukuoka,
Yamaguchi, Hiroshima, Uwajima and Yokohama.

U.S. tourist who killed mugger with bare hands sailing home
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SAN JOSE, Costa Rica 2007-02-24 04:03:35 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A U.S. tourist and the driver of the bus assaulted in Costa Rica recalled on
Friday moments of terror during an attempted robbery that ended when a military
veteran in her tour group killed the young assailant with his bare
hands.
</P>
<P>
Clova Adams, 54, realized the robbery was not a joke when a masked robber put a
gun to her head.
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was a skit. But then he pointed the gun at my head and grabbed me
by the throat and I thought I was going to die," said Adams, speaking by
telephone from the Carnival Liberty cruise ship, referring to the thwarted
robbery Wednesday during a ship stopover in Limon, 130 kilometers (80 miles)
east of San Jose, Costa Rica's capital.
</P>
<P>
Roberto Frances Allen, the Costa Rican driver who was at the wheel of the bus
that was assaulted, recalled gunshots and confusion during the
attack.
</P>
<P>
"I was very scared at the moment. I was driving to try to find help, as the
struggle was going on in the back," Allen said in an interview in
Limon.
</P>
<P>
"The bus was shaking, and women were screaming," he recalled. "There were two
shots and I heard him (Segura) try to fire more, but the gun didn't fire.
Luckily, the tourists had forced his hand up and the shots hit the roof of the
bus."
</P>
<P>
But the mother of the dead assailant, Warner Segura, 20, claimed the group of
tourists of "took the law into their own hands."
</P>
<P>
"I know my boy wasn't staying out of trouble, I knew that any moment I would get
bad news," said Segura's mother, Ligia Herrera Mendez, during an interview in
Limon. Segura had previous charges against him for assault, police
say.
</P>
<P>
"We want justice, this can't go unpunished, because they could have saved him
and nobody helped him," she said. Her son's body was buried Friday in the town
of Liverpool, about 10 miles (15 kilometers) outside Limon.
</P>
<P>
Limon police chief Luis Hernandez said earlier that the tourists drove Segura to
the local Red Cross branch after the confrontation, but he was already
dead.
</P>
<P>
But Herrera Mendez claimed the tourists "left him in the street."
</P>
<P>
Adams was part of a group of 12 American tourists who hired a local driver to
explore Costa Rica for a few hours. They were climbing out of the small bus to a
visit a Caribbean beach when three masked men ran toward them.
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, one of the tourists, a U.S. military veteran estimated to be in his
70s, grabbed the gunman in a headlock.
</P>
<P>
Hernandez said the man -- whom he refused to identify -- struggled with Segura,
breaking his clavicle and eventually killing him. The other two robbers
fled.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican officials interviewed the group, but said they would not charge the
U.S. tourist with any crime because he acted in self defense. "They were in
their right to defend themselves after being held up," Hernandez
said.
</P>
<P>
Herrera Mendez countered that "if this had happened in the United States, the
suspect would have been detained and would not have left the
country.
</P>
<P>
"Why, if they had already taken his gun away, didn't they turn him over to
police, so that he could have had the opportunity to reform himself?"
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica has struggled with violence and crime in recent years. University of
Kansas student Shannon Martin, 23, was stabbed to death in 2001 after she left a
nightclub in Golfito, 105 miles (170 kilometers) south of San
Jose.
</P>
<P>
Carnival Cruise Lines confirmed in a statement that one of the ship's guests had
killed the Costa Rican assailant, but refused to name those involved.
</P>
<P>
"All of the guests involved, who had booked the cruise together as a group, have
opted to continue with their vacation plans. Carnival is providing full support
and assistance to the guests," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The ship was sailing back to the U.S. on Friday, due to arrive Sunday in Fort
Lauderdale, Florida.

Slow down and watch out for whales, Spain tells ships in Strait of Gibraltar
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MADRID, Spain 2007-02-24 15:15:22 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Spain wants ships passing through the Strait of Gibraltar -- one of the world's
busiest maritime routes -- to slow down and watch out for whales.
</P>
<P>
The navy issued the recommendation this month, urging ships to go no faster than
13 knots and sail "in a maximum state of vigilance" so as not to collide with
the mammals. Sailing speeds in the strait separating Europe from Africa vary
greatly but can reach 30 knots in the case of high-speed ferries. A knot is 1.15
mph (1.85 kph).
</P>
<P>
Collisions between ships and whales are hard to document, but Spanish
environmentalists have been pressing for years for a measure like the one Spain
has just announced.
</P>
<P>
Renaud de Stephanis, a marine biologist with the Center for Conservation,
Information and Research on Cetaceans, an environmental group based on Spain's
southern coast, on Saturday called the step historic -- "the first time in the
Mediterranean, and probably in Europe, a measure of this kind has been
taken."
</P>
<P>
Fast ferries are the big danger for endangered sperm whales -- huge, lumbering
creatures that surface to breath and come into the strait from the Mediterranean
from February to July to feed.
</P>
<P>
"They do not know what is going on around them," said Katharina Heyer, president
of the Foundation for Information and Research on Marine Mammals, another
environmental group, based in the Spanish town of Tarifa overlooking the
strait.
</P>
<P>
She said figures on ship-whale collisions in the waterway linking the Atlantic
and the Mediterranean are scarce, but "it does happen."
</P>
<P>
During the feeding season, the strait is home to 20-30 sperm whales, which
measure up to 18 meters long (60 feet) and year-round there is a population of
about 300 smaller pilot whales, said de Stephanis.
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem is that currents in the strait are so strong that when a
whale does get hit the water quickly washes it into the open Mediterranean,
making it hard to keep track of collisions, de Stephanis said.
</P>
<P>
A CIRCE report prepared for the Spanish environment ministry said that from
2001-2005 there were two confirmed collisions with sperm whales in the Strait
and three other reported ones involving species called fin whales.
</P>
<P>
De Stephanis said that while on a research mission in September 2002 he happened
to witness one of those crashes between a sperm whale and a ferry, this one
heading from Morocco to Spain. The vessel did not stop after hitting the
whale.
</P>
<P>
"Its ribs were broken and it had a very big internal hemorrhage," De Stephanis
said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
The whale bled for about an hour and died, and was then towed into the
Mediterranean by a maritime rescue vessel to get the carcass out of the shipping
lanes.

Iran has pardoned and released a French tourist convicted of taking photos of
ships in the Persian Gulf, the French Foreign Ministry said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Stephane Lherbier, arrested along with a German national in November 2005, was

Douste-Blazy welcomed the release and expressed hope that the German, Donald
Klein, would also be released in the coming days.
</P>

The two were arrested for straying into Iran's territorial waters during a
sailing trip off the coast of neighboring United Arab Emirates. Iran's Foreign
Ministry confirmed in January 2006 that they were tried and convicted, but gave

8 Haitians die, 44 missing after boat catches on fire off Dominican Republic
</HEADLINE>

SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic 2007-03-01 23:55:01 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A boat carrying Haitian migrants caught fire off the coast of the Dominican
Republic, leaving at least eight passengers dead and 44 missing, a U.S. Coast
Guard spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The boat was traveling from the northern Haitian town of Cap-Haitien to the
Turks and Caicos when it caught fire about 23 miles (37 kilometers) north of the
Dominican Republic, U.S. Coast Guard spokesman Petty Officer Barry Bena
said.
</P>
<P>
Two migrants were pulled from the water Wednesday and brought to a hospital in
Montecristi on the Dominican Republic's north coast.
</P>
<P>
It appeared the migrants had been in the water for at least a day when they were
spotted by a U.S. sailboat cruising from Panama, said Capt. Jose Antonio
Carrero, commander of the Dominican Navy's northern operations.
</P>
<P>
"They found just the two people, not the boat, not anything," Carrero
said.
</P>
<P>
Those rescued, a man and a woman, were being treated Thursday for first-degree
burns and dehydration, Dr. Maria Belliard said.
</P>
<P>
Eight of the passengers were found dead in the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Coast Guard cutter, two airplanes and a helicopter were searching for
other survivors, Bena said. A Dominican Navy ship assisted in rescue efforts
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Authorities did not know when the blaze occurred, when the migrants set sail or
what caused the fire.
</P>
<P>
Fleeing grinding poverty and frequent political turmoil, thousands of Haitians
take to the sea each year, sailing on flimsy boats north toward Florida. Nearly
all of them are intercepted and repatriated to their homeland, where the vast
majority of its 8 million population lives on less than US$1 (euro.76) a
day.
</P>
<P>
The number of boat migrants increased after a 2004 revolt toppled then president
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, sending the economy into tailspin and touching off a
bloody wave of street violence.

Coast Guard searches for 49 Haitian migrants off Dominican Republic ' s coast

<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Coast Guard crews searched waters off the north coast of the Dominican
Republic Friday for 49 Haitian migrants missing since their homemade boat caught
fire, an agency spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
At least five people died when the fiberglass vessel the migrants were
apparently taking from the northern Haitian town of Cap-Haitien to the Turks and
Caicos Islands caught fire about 23 miles (37 kilometers) north of the Dominican
Republic. Authorities did not know when the blaze occurred, when the migrants
set sail or what caused the fire.
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard mistakenly reported having found eight passengers dead on
Thursday because a pilot counted some bodies twice, according to U.S. Coast
Guard spokesman Petty Officer Barry Bena. Five bodies were found by a
Liberian-flagged merchant marine ship on Thursday, Bena said.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Coast Guard cutter, airplane and helicopter have not located any other
bodies or survivors in the 1,250 square mile (3,237 sq. kilometer)
area.
</P>
<P>
Two of what is estimated to have been 54 passengers on the boat were plucked
from the Atlantic on Tuesday afternoon by an American couple sailing from Panama
to Antigua.
</P>
<P>
"I spotted an odd shape in the water. I thought it was a buoy," Jan Hein, a
53-year-old elementary school teacher from Gig Harbor, Washington, told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
But as she and husband Bruce Smith piloted their 34-foot wooden sailboat closer,
curiosity turned to horror when they realized the shape was a man and a woman
clinging to a stringy, charred piece of fiberglass.
</P>
<P>
"They were suffering," Hein said by phone from aboard their boat, the Woodwind,
which was ported Friday in the northcoast Dominican town of Montecristi.
</P>
<P>
Hein and Smith lifted 27-year-old Djenson Loucien and a 23-year-old woman named
Julie into their boat, washed the salt out of their burn wounds and tried to
keep them warm after issuing a distress call.
</P>
<P>
The migrants told the Heins they had possibly spent days clinging to the
wreckage after a gas tank exploded while refueling at night.
</P>
<P>
The American couple sailed five hours south to the Dominican coast when no help
came to meet them. Another sailboat owner answered their call upon arriving in
Montecristi and helped rush the two Haitians to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
The pair were in stable condition Friday, and could spend at least two more
weeks in the hospital, said Dr. Braulio Manuel Reynoso. Hein said their care was
being paid for by the other sailboat owner, a developer with projects in the
Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with
Haiti.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Haitians take to the sea on flimsy boats each year, heading north
toward Florida to escape grinding poverty and frequent political turmoil in the
Western Hemisphere's poorest country. Nearly all are intercepted and repatriated
to their homeland, where the vast majority of the nation's 8 million people
lives on less than US$1 (euro0.76) a day.

As yachts go mega, so do marinas
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico 2007-03-04 01:13:41 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the yachts get bigger and more numerous, the Caribbean is running out of
parking space.
</P>
<P>
The answer to this invasion of the so-called megayachts? Megamarinas.
</P>
<P>
From the Bahamas in the north to St. Lucia in the south, island governments and
entrepreneurs in the Caribbean and western Atlantic are developing waterfront
property and expanding marinas to handle yachts that range from 80 feet (24
meters) to longer than a football field.
</P>
<P>
The goal is to lure the ultra-rich yachting set and the millions of dollars it
can pour into the local economies.
</P>
<P>
Leading the pack is Yacht Haven Grande in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, which
is being upgraded at a cost of US$200 million (euro151.94 million) in a part of
Charlotte Amalie harbor once so blighted that boaters called it "rat
haven."
</P>
<P>
Promoted as the largest megayacht facility in the Caribbean, the marina has
hosted Rising Sun, a 452-foot (138-meter), five-story behemoth with 82 rooms and
a generator capable of powering a small town. The megayacht, the world's fifth
largest, was built for Oracle Corp. co-founder and CEO Larry
Ellison.
</P>
<P>
Yacht Haven Grande features in-slip systems that can pump 150 gallons (568
liters) of fuel a minute, supply ample electricity, remove sewage and oil and
provide gourmet food and drink served by marina employees in crisp
uniforms.
</P>
<P>
In Grenada, workers recently broke ground on a privately funded US$562 million
(euro426.95 million) resort and marina with spaces for 280 boats, a dozen of
them for yachts longer than 250 feet (76 meters), plus two hotels and hundreds
of condos and apartments.
</P>
<P>
In Puerto Rico, the Ports Authority is seeking a developer for a marina with at
least 60 slips for megayachts.
</P>
<P>
And in the Caribbean's duty-free mecca of St. Maarten, the government expanded
the Simpson Bay Lagoon channel by 20 feet (6 meters) and rebuilt a bridge to
accommodate the Dutch territory's increasing megayacht traffic.
</P>
<P>
Critics say the owners of smaller sailboats will ultimately be squeezed out and
the environment will suffer. But there is little organized opposition.
</P>
<P>
"Anything of any mega-size is obviously a concern in the industry, but it
doesn't seem that anyone has raised any red flags," said Deirdre Shurland,
director of the Puerto Rico-based Caribbean Alliance for Sustainable Tourism, a
hotel-owners group that advocates eco-friendly tourism.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the popularity of megayachts -- for those who can afford them -- is red
hot.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the world had fewer than 700 private owners with boats over 80 feet (24
meters). Today, there are an estimated 7,000 yachts over 80 feet (24 meters) in
use, according to ShowBoats International, a publication that tracks vessel
construction.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Forbes magazine reports there were 793 billionaires last year
-- 317 more than in 2003.
</P>
<P>
"People want to build their own island, their own safe and secure private world.
No better way than aboard a yacht," said Jill Bobrow, editor-in-chief of
ShowBoats International.
</P>
<P>
Americans, the world leaders in big-boat sailing, are largely driving the craze.
But builders say more are emerging from the Middle East, Russia and Eastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Mediterranean megayacht berths outnumber the Caribbean's by 10-to-1, according
to Michael J. Howorth, a British maritime writer and yacht captain. "There's no
place else to build in the Mediterranean and there's a lot of local antipathy to
new marinas."
</P>
<P>
In the Caribbean, megayachtsmen suffer from "an acute shortage of large
megayacht marinas," said British entrepreneur Peter de Savary, a megayacht owner
who is financing the Grenada project.
</P>
<P>
Many in the region's nautical industry, from harbor masters to marine suppliers,
say the bigger-is-better trend has taken them by surprise, but they welcome
it.
</P>
<P>
"It's been great for the economy, so I say 'Long may the megayacht live!'" said
Tom Patterson, manager of the Antigua Yacht Club in English Harbor, Antigua,
which has slips for megayachts. "These people are the wealthiest tourists in the
world."

A German tourist who was arrested with a Frenchman after their boat allegedly
strayed into Iranian waters has been freed from prison in Tehran, Foreign
Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Donald Klein, a 52-year-old sculptor, was arrested by Iran along with Stephane
Lherbier in November 2005 after entering Iran's territorial waters during a
sailing trip off the coast of neighboring United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
The two were convicted in January 2006 and sentenced to 18 months in prison.
Though Iran's Foreign Ministry at the time confirmed that they were tried and
convicted, it gave no other details of their case.
</P>
<P>
When Lherbier was released last month, however, the French Foreign Ministry said
he had been convicted of taking photos of ships in the Persian
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Steinmeier said Klein had been released into the custody of the German Embassy
in Tehran and would be brought home as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
No other details were immediately available.

Asian nations push for more exposure in cruise market
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MIAMI BEACH, Florida 2007-03-15 00:05:16 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Port of Shanghai is getting a new cruise passenger terminal. Southeast Asian
nations are teaming up on a Web site for cruise travelers. Officials from China
are using the 2008 Olympics to promote a triangle of northern cruise
ports.
</P>
<P>
Asia is cruising's new frontier.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the Asia-Pacific region this week began an aggressive
marketing campaign with the goal of making Asia a competitor in the world cruise
market. In town for the Seatrade Cruise Shipping Conference, many toured ports
in Miami and Port Everglades to get a sense of U.S. port operations.
</P>
<P>
"Asia is blooming, maybe because people are too familiar with the south
Caribbean or South America, and you know Europe is too expensive," said Michael
C.Y. Chang, director of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in New York.
"Most of the countries in Asia are in a very good shape and it's reasonable in
cost and it has major wonders and culture."
</P>
<P>
Today, the Asia-Pacific region lags behind the Caribbean, Europe and Alaska as a
cruise destination. But Asian officials say there is long-term growth potential
for a region with improving ports and alluring destinations. They predict that
cruising in the region will grow 40 percent to 1.5 million passengers in
2010.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure is mentioned as a major obstacle for ship and passenger capacity,
with many ports falling short of having adequate transportation in and out of
port facilities. Security, deployment costs and marketing to Asian travelers are
other challenges.
</P>
<P>
The world's largest two cruise operators, Carnival Corp. and Royal Caribbean
Cruises, are establishing a presence in Asia. Carnival Corp.'s Costa Cruises
already offers Asia-Pacific vacations on the Costa Allegra, and Royal
Caribbean's Rhapsody of the Seas will become the largest ship in the region when
it deploys in December. Both ships will target Asia as a source
market.
</P>
<P>
Colin Veitch, president and CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line, a wholly owned
subsidiary of Star Cruises Group, said Star Cruises, which sails in the
Asia-Pacific region, has seen bureaucratic issues related to cruising in China
and a reluctance of Asians to take trips longer than two or three
days.
</P>
<P>
"From listening to what goes on out there, I know Star's operation is somewhat
different, very localized, and is concentrated on very short cruises," Veitch
said. "The Asian domestic market appears to be really quite small in terms of
what we understand of a cruise vacation. My personal view is, I think it's going
to take some time for that to develop."
</P>
<P>
The Port of Shanghai is addressing some infrastructure concerns by investing in
a terminal to hold three 80,000-gross-ton cruise ships and 1 million passengers
per day. Shanghai's busy port already is served by Costa, Princess Cruises and
Holland America Line, which fall under the umbrella of Carnival
Corp.
</P>
<P>
"Cruises are quite new to the Chinese people, so it's important for us to
educate the public about the cruise ship lifestyle," said Chen Xuyuan, president
of the Shanghai International Port Group.
</P>
<P>
The port of Tianjin is billed as the gateway to Beijing, which will host the
2008 Summer Olympics. Two other north China ports, Dalian and Qingdao, are set
to have new cruise terminals within the next three years.
</P>
<P>
China is working closely with Korea and Japan to boost cruise travel in
northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, collaborated on
a Web site to promote the Southeast Asian cruise industry, which is predicted to
grow 5 percent per year until 2020, to about 820,000 passengers. The site
directs users to a site for each ASEAN country and gives executives access to
port information.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN Cruise Working Group also plans to train travel agents on cruising,
pursue infrastructure development and build relationships with the cruise
industry, said chairman Kevin Leong.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan had just 24,000 cruise passengers last year and does not have direct
sailings to China because of political issues. However, it would like to
increase its exposure to cruise passengers by targeting source markets of the
United States, Japan, Hong Kong and Macau, said Kuo Su Tsan-Yang, deputy general
of Taiwan Tourism Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Another company in the region is Seabourn Cruise Line, which services ports in
Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam and elsewhere. Peter Cox, Seabourn's director of
itinerary planning and development, cites security as a concern for cruise lines
looking at the Asia-Pacific market.
</P>
<P>
Bombings in Bali and incidents in the Philippines have led Seabourn to stop
sailing to Indonesia and the Philippines for now.
</P>
<P>
That said, there is "tremendous" potential for growth in Asia, but not right
away, Cox said.

<P>
Panamanian police seized a boat off the nation's Pacific coast carrying 19.4
metric tons (21.4 tons) of cocaine in one of the biggest maritime cocaine busts
on record, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
National police working with agents from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency seized
the boat on Sunday near the island of Coiba, said a police official who asked
his name not be used because he was not authorized to speak on the
record.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested 12 men on the boat, including Mexicans and Panamanians, and
another two suspects in Panama City in connection with the drugs, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
The boat, which was sailing under a Panamanian flag, was being transported to
Panama City on Monday, he said.
</P>
<P>
Drug cartels often smuggle Colombian cocaine along Panama's Pacific coast en

Global warming and new technology heat up race for riches in melting Arctic
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HAMMERFEST, Norway 2007-03-23 00:36:40 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Barren and uninhabited, Hans Island is very hard to find on a
map.
</P>
<P>
Yet these days the Frisbee-shaped rock in the Arctic is much in demand -- so much
so that Canada and Denmark have both staked their claim to it with flags and
warships.
</P>
<P>
The reason: an international race for oil, fish, diamonds and shipping routes,
accelerated by the impact of global warming on Earth's frozen
north.
</P>
<P>
The latest report by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says the
ice cap is warming faster than the rest of the planet and ice is receding,
partly due to greenhouse gases. It's a catastrophic scenario for the Arctic
ecosystem, for polar bears and other wildlife, and for Inuit populations whose
ancient cultures depend on frozen waters.
</P>
<P>
But some see a lucrative silver lining of riches waiting to be snatched from the
deep, and the prospect of timesaving sea lanes that could transform the shipping
industry the way the Suez Canal did in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Geological Survey estimates the Arctic has as much as 25 percent of the
world's undiscovered oil and gas. Moscow reportedly sees the potential of
minerals in its slice of the Arctic sector approaching US$2 trillion (euro1.5
trillion).
</P>
<P>
All this has pushed governments and businesses into a scramble for sovereignty
over these suddenly priceless seas.
</P>
<P>
Regardless of climate change, oil and gas exploration in the Arctic is moving
full speed ahead. State-controlled Norwegian oil company Statoil ASA plans to
start tapping gas from its offshore Snoehvit field in December, the first in the
Barents Sea. It uses advanced equipment on the ocean floor, remote-controlled
from the Norwegian oil boom town of Hammerfest through a 90-mile (145-kilometer)
undersea cable.
</P>
<P>
Alan Murray, an analyst with the energy consultants Wood Mackenzie, said most
petroleum companies are now focusing research and exploration on the far north.
Russia is developing the vast Shkotman natural gas field off its Arctic coast,
and Norwegians hope their advanced technology will find a place
there.
</P>
<P>
"Oil will bring a big geopolitical focus. It is a driving force in the Arctic,"
said Arvid Jensen, a consultant in Hammerfest who advises companies that hope to
hitch their economic wagons to the northern rush.
</P>
<P>
It could open the North Pole region to easy navigation for five months a year,
according to the latest Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, an intergovernmental
group. That could cut sailing time from Germany to Alaska by 60 percent, going
through Russia's Arctic instead of the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
Or the Northwest Passage could open through the channels of Canada's Arctic
islands and shorten the voyage from Europe to the Far East. And that's where
Hans Island, at the entrance to the Northwest Passage, starts to
matter.
</P>
<P>
The half-square-mile (1.3-square-kilometer) rock, just one-seventh the size of
New York's Central Park, is wedged between Canada's Ellesmere Island and
Danish-ruled Greenland, and for more than 20 years has been a subject of
unusually bitter exchanges between the two NATO allies.
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Denmark's minister for Greenland affairs, Tom Hoeyem, caused a stir
when he flew in on a chartered helicopter, raised a Danish flag on the island,
buried a bottle of brandy at the base of the flagpole and left a note saying:
"Welcome to the Danish island."
</P>
<P>
The dispute erupted again two years ago when Canadian Defense Minister Bill
Graham set foot on the rock while Canadian troops hoisted the Maple Leaf
flag.
</P>
<P>
Denmark sent a letter of protest to Ottawa, while Canadians and Danes took out
competing Google ads, each proclaiming sovereignty over the rock 680 miles
(1,100 kilometers) south of the North Pole.
</P>
<P>
Some Canadians even called for a boycott of Danish pastries.
</P>
<P>
Although both countries have repeatedly sent warships to the island to make
their presence felt, there's no risk of a shooting war -- both sides are resolved
to settle the problem peacefully. But the prospect of a warmer planet opening up
the icy waters has helped push the issue up the agenda.
</P>
<P>
"We all realize that because of global warming it will suddenly be an area that
will become more accessible," said Peter Taksoe-Jensen, head of the Danish
Foreign Ministry's legal department.
</P>
<P>
Shortcuts through Arctic waters are no longer the stuff of science
fiction.
</P>
<P>
In August 2005, the Akademik Fyodorov of Russia was the first ship to reach the
North Pole without icebreaker help. The Norwegian shipyard Aker Yards is
building innovative vessels that sail forward in clear waters, and then turn
around to plow with their sterns through heavier ice.
</P>
<P>
Global warming is also bringing an unexpected bonus to American transportation
company OmniTrax Inc., which a decade ago bought the small underutilized
Northwest Passage port of Churchill, Manitoba, for a token fee of 10 Canadian
dollars (about US$8;euro6).
</P>
<P>
The company, which is private, won't say how much money it is making in
Churchill, but it was estimated to have moved more than 500,000 tons of grain
through the port in 2007.
</P>
<P>
Managing director Michael Ogborn said climate change was not something the
company thought about in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"But over the last 10 years we saw a lengthening of the season, which appears to
be related to global warming," Ogborn said. "We see the trend
continuing."
</P>
<P>
Just a few years ago, reports said it would take 100 years for the ice to melt,
but recent studies say it could happen in 10-15 years, and the United States,
Canada, Russia, Denmark and Norway have been rushing to stake their claims in
the Arctic.
</P>
<P>
Norway and Russia have issues in the Barents Sea; the U.S. and Russia in
Beaufort Sea; the U.S. and Canada over rights to the Northwest Passage; and even
Alaska and Canada's Yukon province over their offshore boundary.
</P>
<P>
Canada, Russia and Denmark are seeking to claim waters all the way up to the
North Pole, saying the seabed is part of their continental shelf under the 1982
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Norway wants to extend its
claims on the same basis, although not all the way to the pole.
</P>
<P>
Canada says the Northwest Passage is its territory, a claim the United States
hotly disputes, insisting the waters are neutral. Canadian Prime Minister
Stephen Harper has pledged to put military icebreakers in the frigid waters "to
assert our sovereignty and take action to protect our territorial
integrity."
</P>
<P>
Politics aside, there are environmental concerns. Apart from the risk of oil
spills, more vessels could carry alien organisms into the Northwest Passage,
posing a risk to indigenous life forms.
</P>
<P>
The Arctic melt has also been intensifying competition over dwindling fishing
stocks.
</P>
<P>
Fish stocks essential to some regions appear to be moving to colder waters, and
thus into another country's fishing grounds. Russian and Norwegian fishermen
already report catching salmon much farther north than is normal.
</P>
<P>
"It is potentially very dramatic for fish stocks. They could move toward the
North Pole, which would make sovereignty very unclear," said Dag Vongraven, an
environmental expert at the Norwegian Polar Institute.
</P>
<P>
Russia contests Norway's claims to fish-rich waters around the Arctic Svalbard
Islands, and has even sent warships there to underscore its discontent with the
Norwegian Coast Guard boarding Russian trawlers there.
</P>
<P>
"Even though they say it is about fish, it is really about oil," said Jensen,
the consultant in Hammerfest.
</P>
<P>
In 2004, Russian President Vladimir Putin called the sovereignty issue "a
serious, competitive battle" that "will unfold more and more
fiercely."
</P>
<P>
With all the squabbling over ownership, Tristan Pearce, a research associate at
the University of Guelph's Global Environmental Change Group in Canada, reminded
Arctic nations of who got there first: indigenous peoples like the Inuits and
the Sami.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is talking about the potential for minerals, diamonds, oil and gas,
but we mustn't forget that people live there, all the way across the Arctic," he
said. "They've always been there and they have a major role to
play."

Italian patrol ship intercepts boat full of migrants off Senegal ' s coast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An Italian coast guard vessel intercepted a merchant ship carrying 350 suspected
illegal migrants off Senegal's coast, Italian authorities said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Italian coast guard officials intercepted the 52-meter (170-foot-) long
North Korean-flagged ship on Thursday evening at the request of Spanish
authorities, said Capt. Cristiano Aliperto, a coast guard spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The Italian ship is part of a European Union patrol of the waters off Africa's
west coast in a bid to stem illegal immigration. Last year, more than 30,000
immigrants, mostly sub-Saharan Africans, were intercepted while trying to reach
Spain's Canary Islands last year, after sailing from west Africa in crowded
boats.
</P>
<P>
Authorities believe that the ship intercepted by the Italians about 80 miles
(125 kilometers) north of Dakar was headed toward the Canaries, Aliperta said.
Most of the passengers were from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, along with a
few Nigerians, the captain said. They were in good condition.
</P>
<P>
The ship was being escorted by the Italian coast guard vessel and was expected
to arrive in Dakar's port later on Friday, Aliperta said.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the crew of six Georgians risked being charged with
trafficking in human beings.

BMW Oracle not concerned with Alinghi just yet
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
VALENCIA, Spain 2007-04-02 12:28:08 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten of the 11 challengers for the America's Cup will use the Louis Vuitton Act
13 to gauge their boats against defending champion Alinghi.
</P>
<P>
BMW Oracle skipper Chris Dickson, however, isn't worried about the Swiss boat
just yet.
</P>
<P>
He believes Act 13 is Alinghi's best chance to measure itself against the field
before the challengers face-off in the Louis Vuitton Cup -- which decides who
will face Alinghi in the America's Cup from June 23-July 4.
</P>
<P>
"The standard and level of the challengers is at a very high level across the
board. This act is more important for Alinghi checking in against the
challengers and not the other way around," Dickson said Monday. "So, as usual,
it should be very interesting."
</P>
<P>
Alinghi skipper Brad Butterworth said Alinghi would treat Act 13, which begins
Tuesday, like any other race.
</P>
<P>
"It's good for us to sail against the other teams," Butterworth said. "We'll
take something, but it's not the same as sailing in a match race. It's difficult
in a fleet race to get a good idea."
</P>
<P>
The Swiss team will be forced into training after Act 13 finishes Friday. It
will then await the winner of the Louis Vuitton Cup, which runs from April
16-June 11. Alinghi can train with any of the other 11 challengers until then, a
scenario Dickson wanted no part of.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly we have no plans to sail against Alinghi," Dickson said. "We thought
about it and there's no sporting reason and it would help no one but Alinghi if
we did that."
</P>
<P>
Emirates Team New Zealand leader Dean Baker welcomed the chance to train with
the defending champions.
</P>
<P>
"It's another opportunity to sail against the benchmark team that since 2003 has
been the best," Baker said. "To prepare for the (Louis Vuitton) Cup, what better
way is there to get ready?"
</P>
<P>
Act 13 should be a good test for all the boats involved -- both against opponents
and against themselves.
</P>
<P>
"We're getting ready to race," said +39 Challenge helmsman Iain Percy, whose
team has been dogged by financial problems. "It's a frantic moment in our own
base but we're getting excited to see how we line up."
</P>
<P>
Emirates Team New Zealand leads the rankings with 125 points, followed by BMW
Oracle Racing with 123 and Luna Rossa Challenge with 118.
</P>
<P>
Act 13 is worth triple points with teams receiving bonus points since Alinghi is
not factored into the standings. Points are carried into the round-robin stage
of the Louis Vuitton Cup, which could mean the difference in a
tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
Newcomers China Team and Shosholoza of South Africa will hope to surprise the
field, while teams like Areva Challenge, Victory Challenge, Desafio Espanol and
Mascalzone Latino will look to avoid slipping further down the
standings.
</P>
<P>
With a condensed sailing schedule leaving teams with little time to make changes
to boats that haven't shown any radical hull or keel bulb transformations, there
is a chance the competition could field the tightest race ever.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if (the racing) will get any closer than last time but I certainly
hope so," United Internet Team Germany skipper Jesper Bank said. "It really
depends on how the individual teams go ahead and use their packages which will
make the biggest difference."

BMW Oracle Racing comes from behind to win first race of Act 13

<TEXT>
<P>
BMW Oracle Racing overtook America's Cup champion Alinghi on the final drag
Tuesday to complete a come-from-behind victory in the first fleet race of the
Louis Vuitton Act 13.
</P>
<P>
The American team rounded the first windmarker in 10th place after skipper Chris
Dickson chose to tack left. Dickson slowly worked the USA 87 boat back up the
leaderboard, before jibe-peeling to a spinnaker on the final drag to propel it
past the defending champions.
</P>
<P>
Alinghi started from the back after being penalized for crossing the starting
line early. The Swiss team recovered quickly and was on course for a
second-place finish before the shifty winds slowed the SUI 91 boat to a near
halt near the end of the final drag.
</P>
<P>
Trailing surprise leader +39 Challenge by less than a minute through the third
marker, Alinghi gybed past Italian boat Mascalzone Latino at the halfway mark of
the final drag before BMW Oracle Racing -- which was seventh after the final turn
-- sped past the Swiss team on starboard gybe for the win.
</P>
<P>
Shosholoza of South Africa gybed past Alinghi to finish second, 3 minutes, 34
seconds behind. Mascalzone Latino was third, 4:18 behind.
</P>
<P>
Alinghi finished 5:04 back in fourth, 12 seconds ahead of Emirates Team New
Zealand, the ACC Season Championship winner two of the past three
years.
</P>
<P>
+39 Challenge, which was 10th, was the surprise leader until it lost its
spinnaker after rounding the third windmarker. The Italian syndicate was sailing
in its new ITA 85 boat, which had only been outfitted with a new mast late
Monday, and was the last team on the course after crew worked on the boat
through the night.
</P>
<P>
Helmsman Iain Percy chose to tack to the strong right side wind on the first
drag, a move that propelled +39 Challenge to a 48 second lead over Mascalzone
Latino by the second marker.
</P>
<P>
The second stage of seven stages will be raced later Tuesday, with BMW Oracle
Racing leading the standings with 12 points, one more than Shosholoza.
Mascalzone Latino has 10 points in third.
</P>
<P>
Act 13 is worth triple points with teams receiving bonus points since Alinghi is
not factored into the standings. Points are carried into the round-robin stage
of the Louis Vuitton Cup, which could mean the difference in a tiebreaker. The
Louis Vuitton Cup, which takes place from April 16-June 11, will decide who
challenges Alinghi for the America's Cup from June 23-July 4.

Alinghi sweeps second day of Act 13
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
America's Cup champion Alinghi swept the second day of racing Wednesday at the
Louis Vuitton Act 13.
</P>
<P>
Alinghi barely won the third race of Act 13 after cruising to a strong finish
ahead of Desafio Espanol of Spain in the second race.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss boat couldn't keep tack as BMW Oracle Racing whipped around the final
marker and into the lead in the late race. The American boat's turn of speed had
been dominant, but the streaky conditions left it -- along with many of the fleet
-- momentarily stationary 300 meters (yards) from the finish line as jib's failed
to catch wind.
</P>
<P>
Alinghi helmsman Ed Baird finally found the breeze and was forced to tack at the
finish line but still cleared it 14 seconds ahead of Italian team Luna Rossa.
Desafio Espanol finished 29 seconds behind in third despite having been
penalized after an early start.
</P>
<P>
"Up to that point we were having a good race and had a lead going down that run,
we just didn't see it coming," BMW Oracle Racing trimmer Ross Halcrow said. "A
few huffs were coming through and we got one big puff there that broke a
symmetrical pole and one of our guys went over the side and we picked him up as
we went by, though I don't know if anyone saw it."
</P>
<P>
A stewards' jury will meet later Wednesday to review protests filed by +39
Challenger and United Internet Team Germany that resulted in neither team
finishing the race. +39 Challenger lodged its protest against United Internet
Team Germany, while the German team lodged its against French syndicate
Areva.
</P>
<P>
The Germans broke a rig as a result of a collision that took place at the first
windward mark, while the Italian team's new mast snapped in three places two
days after the team had worked through the night installing it.
</P>
<P>
Alinghi leads the standings with 33 points, five more than both BMW Oracle
Racing and Emirates Team New Zealand. Desafio Espanol is fourth with 26
points.
</P>
<P>
Despite the last lap glitch, Halcrow said the American team was pleased since
its performance could have been a lot worse.
</P>
<P>
"All in all we're pretty happy with the day," Halcrow said. "It's unfortunate
the pole broke but we got without injuries, and we could have broken the
mast."
</P>
<P>
And despite the sweep, Alinghi trimmer Simon Daubney believes the team still has
some areas to improve on.
</P>
<P>
"We don't seem to be getting the starts we're looking for. Maybe we're just
trying to hard to get the end we want but we always seem to be in the second
row," Daubney said. "But it's a completely different thing from match racing and
we're working on it."
</P>
<P>
In the early race, BMW Oracle Racing skipper Chris Dickson couldn't hold his USA
87 boat from crossing the start early, costing the American team an early
penalty as the other 11 teams charged across the starting line.
</P>
<P>
Mascalzone Latino kept pace with Alinghi initially before skipper Vasco Vascotto
was red-flagged for impeding the Swiss boat's progress in a crowded middle
section of the course.
</P>
<P>
Dickson raced his boat up from eighth to fourth behind the New Zealand team as
the breeze moved to the right, forcing the teams to come down on port gybe. Six
teams were within a minute of the leader after the second turn.
</P>
<P>
A left hand shift of wind kept gave the leaders a comfortable downwind lead
around the final marker, with the Spanish team holding its second-place position
and BMW Oracle Racing unable to overtake the Kiwis and third place as it put up
its symmetrical jibe in the rolling breeze.
</P>
<P>
"(Alinghi's) a great sailing team and still the team to beat, and the way they
were sailing today proved it," Halcrow said.
</P>
<P>
With Alinghi's points not factored into the final standings, bonus points will
be awarded to the 11 challengers following Act 13, which is worth triple points.
The points are carried into the round-robin stage of the Louis Vuitton Cup,
which could mean the difference in a tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
The Louis Vuitton Cup, which takes place from April 16-June 11, will decide who
challenges Alinghi for the America's Cup from June 23-July 4.

British sailors and marines held captive for 13 days return to London
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ROYAL MARINE BASE CHIVENOR, England 2007-04-05 16:12:28 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Royal Navy crew broke into applause after landing on British soil Thursday,
basking in relief shared by a nation after their release from 13 days of
captivity in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair welcomed their release and insisted no deals had been
for their freedom. He added that "new and interesting lines of communication
opened up" in the course of efforts to bring the 15 home -- "and it's sensible
for us to continue to pursue those." He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Tearful relatives hugged the former prisoners hours after their arrival at a
Royal Marine Base on the southwest British coast, where they were to be
debriefed.
</P>
<P>
Yet the celebrations were subdued for Britain's military, which suffered the
loss of four soldiers and a translator in an ambush in Iraq only hours before
the crew touched down at home. The deaths were the biggest loss of life for
British forces in more than four months.
</P>
<P>
Iran, which accused the Britons of sailing into Iranian waters, did not get the
main thing it sought -- a public apology for that. Britain, which said its crew
was in Iraqi waters when seized, insists it never offered a quid pro quo,
either, instead relying on quiet diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
Some of Britain's tabloids took both Blair and Iranian President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad to task, declaring that "nobody emerges from this crisis with
credit."
</P>
<P>
Blair has said elements of the Iranian regime were supporting and financing
terrorism in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Although Britain was glad of the safe return of the 15, Blair said outside his
Downing Street office, "we return to the sober and ugly reality of what is
happening through terrorism in Iraq, terrorism designed specifically to thwart
the will of the international community."
</P>
<P>
Air Chief Marshall Sir Jock Stirrup met with the crew briefly and described them
as being "happy and in good shape." He dismissed suggestions the sailors and
marines had behaved improperly because they took part in propaganda videos in
which they "admitted" trespassing in Iranian waters.
</P>
<P>
"They did exactly as they should have done from start to finish and we are proud
of them," Stirrup said.
</P>
<P>
But the tabloid Sun disagreed in a hotly worded editorial.
</P>
<P>
"The sight of the illegally detained British forces thanking their Iranian
tyrants for their freedom will sicken the nation," said the tabloid Sun wrote in
its editorial.
</P>
<P>
"Smirking President Ahmadinejad milked the humiliating moment for all it was
worth."
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's announcement by Ahmadinejad that the Britons were being freed was a
breakthrough in a crisis that had raised oil prices and escalated fears of
military conflict in the volatile region. The release of the sailors suggested
that Iran's hard-line leadership decided it had shown its strength, but did not
want to push the standoff too far.
</P>
<P>
The president's announcement defused a growing confrontation between the two
countries. In London, Blair expressed "profound relief" over the peaceful end to
the crisis, telling the Iranian people that "we bear you no ill
will."
</P>
<P>
Syria, Iran's close ally, said it played a role in winning the release. "Syria
exercised a sort of quiet diplomacy to solve this problem and encourage dialogue
between the two parties," the country's Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem said
in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
During the Tehran news conference at which he announced the release of the
Britons, Ahmadindejad said the British government was "not brave enough" to
admit the crew had been in Iranian waters when it was captured.
</P>
<P>
Ahmadinejad then declared that even though Iran had the right to put the Britons
on trial, he had "pardoned" them to mark the March 30 birthday of the Prophet
Muhammad and the coming Easter holiday.
</P>
<P>
"This pardon is a gift to the British people," he said.
</P>
<P>
After the news conference, Iranian television showed a beaming Ahmadinejad
shaking hands with the Britons.
</P>
<P>
"Your people have been really kind to us, and we appreciate it very much," one
of the British men told Ahmadinejad in English. Another male service member
said: "We are grateful for your forgiveness."
</P>
<P>
Ahmadinejad responded in Farsi, "You are welcome."
</P>
<P>
Three members of the crew were later interviewed on Iranian state-run TV,
apologizing for the alleged incursion into Iran's waters and again thanking
Ahmadinejad for their release.
</P>
<P>
"I can understand why you're insulted by the intrusion into the waters," said
Lt. Felix Carman, shown seated on a couch.
</P>
<P>
"Thank you for letting us go and we apologize for our actions, but many thanks
for having it in your hearts to let us go free," Turney said.
</P>
<P>
The United States cautiously welcomed Iran's announcement, though Vice President
Dick Cheney said "it was unfortunate that they were ever taken in the first
place."
</P>
<P>
The British crew was seized March 23 as it searched for smugglers. An infuriated
Britain froze most bilateral contacts, prompting Tehran to roll back on a pledge
to free Turney.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's announcement led some analysts to conclude that Iran's supreme
leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, decided the crisis had gone on long enough at a
time when Tehran faces mounting pressure over its nuclear program. A day after
the British were seized, the U.N. Security Council imposed new sanctions on Iran
for refusing to halt uranium enrichment.

Somali pirates free 2 hijacked ships
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NAIROBI, Kenya 2007-04-07 09:05:46 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Somali pirates have freed two merchant ships they had hijacked off the coast of
the country, a maritime official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"All the crew are safe aboard both vessels," said Andrew Mwangura, head of the
Kenyan chapter of the Seafarers Assistance Program.
</P>
<P>
The ships, the MV Rozen -- a cargo ship that had been delivering U.N. food aid to
northeastern Somalia -- and the MV Nimatullah, are now sailing out of Somali
waters, he said. Both vessels were released late Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mwangura said a ransom had been paid but he did not have details.
</P>
<P>
The MV Rozen and its 12 crew members -- six from Sri Lanka and six from Kenya --
were hijacked on Feb 25. The Indian-flagged MV Nimatullah, which was carrying
more than 800 tons (725 metric tons) of cargo, including cooking oil, secondhand
clothing and rice, and its 14 crew were seized last Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. food agency, which chartered the MV Rozen, welcomed the release of the
ship. "The threat of piracy is, however, very much alive and we urge the Somali
Transitional Federal Government and the Puntland authorities to curb this
menace," said the WFP country director for Somalia, Peter Goossens.
</P>
<P>
Both vessels still remain in danger until they are out of the 12-mile (20
kilometers) territorial limit of Somali waters, Mwangura added. The Rozen was
headed for Mombasa, Kenya. The MV Nimatullah's destination was unclear. Its
Dubai-based owner, Issa Bhata, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
It was also unclear whether any of the pirates that had hijacked the ships had
been detained by local authorities.
</P>
<P>
The British-based International Maritime Bureau warned Wednesday there had been
a marked increase in pirate attacks in Somali waters.
</P>
<P>
"Vessels are advised to steer well clear of Somalian waters at all times and
only approach once full clearance to enter the port has been received," the
organization said in a statement posted on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
The 1,880-mile coast of Somalia, which has had no effective government since
warlords ousted a dictatorship in 1991 and then turned on each other, has
emerged as one of the most dangerous areas for ships.
</P>
<P>
Somali pirates are trained fighters, often dressed in military fatigues, using
speedboats equipped with satellite phones and Global Positioning System
equipment. They are typically armed with automatic weapons, anti-tank rocket
launchers and various types of grenades, according to the U.N. Monitoring Group
on Somalia.
</P>
<P>
In 2005, two ships carrying WFP aid were overwhelmed by pirates. The number of
overall reported at-sea hijackings that year was 35, compared with two in 2004,
according to the International Maritime Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The bandits target both passenger and cargo vessels for ransom or loot, using
the money to buy weapons.

Alinghi secures season championship with victory in the final race of Act 13
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
VALENCIA, Spain 2007-04-07 17:28:53 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Defending America's Cup champion Alinghi won the Louis Vuitton Act season
championship Saturday after winning the final fleet race of Act
13.
</P>
<P>
Alinghi overtook BMW Oracle Racing on the second lap, securing the Swiss team's
second championship with a fourth victory in seven races of Act
13.
</P>
<P>
Alinghi finished with 78 points, 14 more than two-time season winner Emirates
Team New Zealand. Mascalzone Latino was the best of the three Italian
syndicates, finishing third with 63 points after a third-place finish in the
final fleet race.
</P>
<P>
American entry BMW Oracle Racing finished fifth with 57 points -- two less than
Luna Rossa of Italy -- after skipper Chris Dickson recovered from a disappointing
sixth in the sixth race to lead the USA 87 yacht to second in the final race,
its best finish since winning the opener of Act 13.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's two fleet races were the last chance for the 11 challengers to race
against Alinghi. From April 16-June 11, the challengers begin sailing against
each other in a round-robin competition that will determine who advances to race
Alinghi in the America's Cup, from June 23 to July 4.
</P>
<P>
Act 13 is worth triple points with teams receiving bonus points because Alinghi
is not factored into the standings. Points are carried into the round-robin
stage of the Louis Vuitton Cup which could mean the difference in a tiebreaker
for the final places of the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
In the sixth race, Spanish team Desafio Espanol won its first ever fleet race
after overtaking Alinghi halfway through the first lap before winning a last lap
drag race by a boat length.
</P>
<P>
Italy's +39 Challenger was unable to race for the third straight day due to a
broken mast.
</P>
<P>
American helmsman Ed Baird steered Alinghi into the lead after tacking the SUI
91 boat to a middle course from the start, with the Spaniards following and the
rest of the fleet divided between left and right courses.
</P>
<P>
Desafio Espanol helmsman Karol Jablonski crossed ahead of Baird and extended the
Spanish lead to 21 seconds after rounding the windmarker, widening the gap to
138 meters (yards) after a gybe left the Swiss boat on starboard.
</P>
<P>
Dickson took BMW Oracle Racing to the left-hand course before rounding the far
marker and tacking left again on the third lap, a decision that slowed the
Americans as they dropped further behind the leaders.
</P>
<P>
Alinghi cut into Desafio Espanol's lead around the final marker as the Spaniards
had trouble getting the spinnaker out, but the hosts held the course for the
victory, a result that helped push them up to sixth in the final
standings.
</P>
<P>
Also, the Challenger Commission -- a panel comprising the 11 challengers -- ruled
it would not support an amendment to the America's Cup rules that would have
allowed +39 Challenger to use one of United Internet Team Germany's masts. A
jury ruled the Germans were at fault for their collision in Wednesday's third
fleet race.

Argentine icebreaker catches fire in South Atlantic, 296 crew reported safely evacuated
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina 2007-04-11 12:34:30 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Argentine navy's icebreaking ship caught fire off Patagonia, and all 296
aboard were rescued after hours in lifeboats in the chilly waters, the armed
forces said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A fire broke out in the Almirante Irizar's generator area late Tuesday, and
Capt. Guillermo Tarapow ordered all aboard to abandon ship in 24 lifeboats when
the flames became uncontrollable, according to a military statement.
</P>
<P>
An oil tanker and a fishing vessel rushed to the area and plucked the crew from
the South Atlantic waters off the remote Patagonian city of Puerto Madryn, 930
miles (1,500 kilometers) south of the Argentine capital of Buenos Aires. The
military did not report any injuries and didn't give a cause for the
fire.
</P>
<P>
The Almirante Irizar was acquired by the Argentine navy in 1978 and has played
key roles in transporting military personnel and scientists to and from bases
that Argentina operates in Antarctica. It also has been involved in rescue
missions in the region.
</P>
<P>
The high command said the ship was sailing from Ushuaia, the southernmost city
in Argentina, to the capital, 1,515 miles (2,370 kilometers) to the
north.

Some 250 African migrants arrive at Spanish islands in six boats
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MADRID, Spain 2007-04-13 13:41:59 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 250 migrants have arrived in Spain's Canary Islands in the past two days,
officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after midnight, a boat carrying 112 sub-Saharan African arrived at
Gomera island. The occupants, all male adults from countries including Senegal,
Guinea Bissau, Gambia and Sierra Leone, told rescue workers they had spent some
10 days at sea, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The official spoke on condition of anonymity as his government department does
not allow him to be publicly identified.
</P>
<P>
Before dawn, another single-engine vessel carrying 81 migrants was detected in
waters off the nearby island of Tenerife.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, 53 would-be immigrants were caught aboard four other
boats.
</P>
<P>
The influx of boats came after officials had announced that for the first three
months of the year increased European Union patrols off the West African coast
and repatriation and cooperation deals with African countries had seen the
number of migrants arriving in the Canary Islands plunge to 1,905 from 4,498 for
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Last year more than 30,000 immigrants were intercepted while sailing from Africa
to the Canary Islands in small, crowded boats, and officials in the islands say
more than 500 died along the way.

Louis Vuitton Cup ready to crown challenger for the America ' s Cup
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
VALENCIA, Spain 2007-04-15 13:43:14 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A four-year wait to select a challenger to sail against defending America's Cup
champion Alinghi ends Monday with the start of Louis Vuitton
Cup.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss team was the first challenger to win the Auld Mug on its first try by
beating Team New Zealand in 2003, a win that returned the competition to Europe
for the first time since the inaugural race around Britain's Isle of Wight 156
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Teams from Britain and Australia are missing this time and the sole American
entry is BMW Oracle Racing, but the addition of United Internet Team Germany,
China Team and Shosholoza of South Africa has made the competition more
global.
</P>
<P>
"It has been more economically feasible to a team to go ahead and participate in
the Cup which has made it more competitive," Oracle CEO Larry Ellison said
Sunday. "We're all sailing a lot more than we're used to so we're all
benefiting."
</P>
<P>
Budgets range from the Chinese team's low of euro14 million (US$19 million) to
BMW Oracle Racing's euro130 million (US$175 million), but the real difference
between the yachts can be mere millimeters (inches).
</P>
<P>
"If you believe money is the only way to win the Cup, then you are all wrong,"
Areva Challenge owner Stephane Kandler said. "The America's Cup had a big change
this time and the best thing to happen to it was the Acts."
</P>
<P>
Louis Vuitton Act 13 wrapped up three years and 400 match races worth of warm-up
regattas that confirmed Swiss syndicate Alinghi and the big three -- BMW Oracle
Racing, Luna Rossa of Italy and Emirates Team New Zealand -- are still the
favorites. But the Acts also brought other challengers -- Desafio Espanol of
Spain, Mascalzone Latina of Italy and Shosholoza.
</P>
<P>
"What can make the difference is the weather conditions you're sailing in as
well as which team you are taking on," Shosholoza helmsman Paolo Cian said. "We
must be ready from the first day. Because every time you don't achieve your
plan, the race is lost."
</P>
<P>
The first round-robin stage, which ends on April 22, sees each syndicate race
each other twice, with two points earned per win. All move on the second
round-robin stage, from April 25-May 6, with bonus points based on final Act
racing rankings added to the tallies.
</P>
<P>
All teams race each other only once in the second stage, with two points earned
per win, which are added to the first-round scores. The top four move on to the
best-of-nine match race semifinals, from May 14-24, with the round-robin winner
selecting its opponent. The best-of-nine final sails from June
1-11.
</P>
<P>
The South Africans will line up against middle-of-the-pack Victory Challenge of
Sweden on the southern "Juliet" course, a course that could surprise the teams
since most have centered their training around the northern "Romeo"
course.
</P>
<P>
Mascalzone Latino will race the Kiwis before Areva Challenge of France races
Italian team +39 Challenge on "Romeo." The Germans open against the Americans on
"Juliet," while the Chinese -- who finished last in the 11-team Act rankings --
sail against third-place Luna Rossa.
</P>
<P>
Desafio Espanol sits out the first flight and joins Alinghi on the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
Though Alinghi won Act 13, it will not race again before the best-of-nine
America's Cup from June 23-July 4. It can train with any challenger, an offer
the Americans and their new USA-98 boat want no part of.
</P>
<P>
"The game of cat and mouse begins today and to see whether we are the cat or the
mouse is part of meeting with others, but I think a few of the other teams would
like to race against us," billionaire team owner Ernesto Bertarelli said. "If
they choose to isolate us, then we'll do with what we have to."

First day of Louis Vuitton Cup match racing postponed
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
VALENCIA, Spain 2007-04-16 16:48:26 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The start of the Louis Vuitton Cup was postponed Monday because of inconsistent
wind.
</P>
<P>
The 11 competing yachts circled along the race course off Port America's Cup
aided only by a light sea breeze -- until organizers halted the first day of the
challengers series.
</P>
<P>
Racing is expected to resume Tuesday, but Monday's 10 match races are now
scheduled for Friday.
</P>
<P>
It's not the first time the opening day of challenger series racing has been
pushed back.
</P>
<P>
In New Zealand four years ago, the start of the round-robin, quarterfinal and
semifinal stages of the Louis Vuitton Cup were canceled due to excessive
winds.
</P>
<P>
"This is challenging stuff we are facing right now in terms of the weather," BMW
Oracle Racing team owner Larry Ellison said. "I think we will have to sail
conservatively."
</P>
<P>
Sunshine had broken a monthlong spell of rain that had played havoc with the
Louis Vuitton Act 13 fleet-racing schedule, but an inconsistent breeze ensured
there were no round-robin races.
</P>
<P>
"We saw this kind of weather here during the (previous) Acts when we tried to
race outside of peak periods and we had the same result," Luna Rossa
meteorologist Doug Charko said. "Unfortunately, it had to happen on the first
day of racing."
</P>
<P>
Valencia was picked to host the America's Cup because it averages 300 days of
sunshine and temperatures of 19 degrees Celsius (66 Fahrenheit) that usually
provide a strong and consistent breeze.
</P>
<P>
But Spring has brought cold, wet weather and a persistent northeasterly wind
that doesn't aid sailing.
</P>
<P>
"This is not normal, this is not Valencia," +39 Challenge weather tactician Juan
Carlos Oliva said. "This is not England, we're in a low latitude, so we've
already been (experiencing this weather) too long."
</P>
<P>
The last time Valencia received this much rain was in 1957, when the now-drained
Turia river swelled its banks and flooded the city, leaving 81
dead.
</P>
<P>
Since March 21, the city has had 20 days of rain with low temperatures, and
Charko is expecting more of the same until May.
</P>
<P>
"It does look like this pattern is going to continue, which is a bit unusual for
the duration of the month," Charko said. "It's not until May that we'll see a
proper transition to a sea breeze scenario."
</P>
<P>
Light but stronger sea breezes are forecast for Tuesday, but Charko thinks teams
will be lucky to finish even one race.
</P>
<P>
A new low pressure system is also expected from the Atlantic -- which could cause
further delays.
</P>
<P>
"There is a low pressure system coming in from the Atlantic next week, and we
don't know yet what that will throw up either," Oliva said.
</P>
<P>
Alinghi of Switzerland will defend the America's Cup from June 23-July 4 against
the winning boat.
</P>
<P>
All 11 challengers race each other twice in the first round-robin stage, through
April 22 with two points per win. The second round-robin stage -- from April
25-May 6 -- adds bonus points based on final Act racing rankings to the
tallies.
</P>
<P>
All teams race each other once in the second stage, with two points per win
added to the tallies.
</P>
<P>
The top four advance to the best-of-nine match race semifinals from May 14-24,
with the round-robin winner selecting its opponent. The best-of-nine final is
from June 1-11.

South Africans, Chinese set to make history at the America ' s Cup
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
VALENCIA, Spain 2007-04-18 00:05:26 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Captain Richard Brown would have needed to see it to believe it -- boats from
South Africa and China sailing in the America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
Brown captained America to victory in the first America's Cup 156 years ago and
now the names of Shosholoza and China Team will join the schooner in the history
books as the teams from Africa and Asia are set to face off in the opener of the
Louis Vuitton Cup.
</P>
<P>
But that's only if the sea breeze returns after light wind halted the first two
days of challenger series racing.
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to race against them because they have progressed a lot since the
beginning and it will be interesting to see how much we match up," China Team
navigator Tan Wearn Haw said. "It's also something fresh in the America's
Cup."
</P>
<P>
A Zulu word signifying "keep going forward," Shosholoza is the favorite to
emerge from the match race with the first two points of the round-robin stage, a
reflection of the progress the South Africans have made since defending champion
Alinghi accepted them as the third challenger in 2003.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese come into the regatta with the smallest budget -- euro14 million
(US$19 million) -- and a boat that the design team admited was only "just ready"
at the deadline, just as it was in signing up to be the 11th challenger in March
2005.
</P>
<P>
For all of their firsts, including Shosholoza being the first of the 12
syndicates to build a boat to the current class 5 rules, the South Africans are
expecting the most impressive accomplishment of the two syndicates -- advancing
to the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
"We're finished the stage of being an OK team to being a competitive team,"
Shosholoza tactician Tommaso Chieffi said. "The next step is to be the winning
team."
</P>
<P>
Shosholoza has progressed into a middle-of-the-pack threat, finishing seventh in
the 11-team challenger standings following impressive displays in the Louis
Vuitton Act 13, where it placed second to BMW Oracle Racing and ahead of Alinghi
in the first race, it's highest finish in three years of fleet
racing.
</P>
<P>
Despite one of the smallest budgets at euro25 million (US$33.9 million) and a
sailing crew of 24, the results come with little surprise to Chieffi, racing in
his fourth America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
"Since we're starting from scratch, you see the results right away. These big
steps we're making every day make us feel like we're headed in the right
direction," Chieffi said.
</P>
<P>
Though it might have taken over 600 years for China to reassert itself as a
global sea power, China Team admits it is in Valencia with a long-term
plan.
</P>
<P>
"It's a significant and historic event for China," team head Chaoyong Wang said.
"The country has a long history in sailing but we are totally new to this highly
influential and prestigious game."
</P>
<P>
Chaoyong, a Harvard University graduate, agreed to take over the defunct Le Defi
in December 2005 after the French team mounted campaigns in 2000 and
2003.
</P>
<P>
It's been catchup ever since, though Wearn Haw said the team hardly
minds.
</P>
<P>
"We try not to get too excited because we know its going to be an uphill
struggle for us," the 28-year-old from Singapore said. "But we look forward to
each race because it shows us our strengths and shortcomings and though the
results might not come right away, it builds our knowledge base for the next
challenge."
</P>
<P>
With the five Chinese members of the sailing crew having little time to ready
themselves for Valencia, communication has been the major problem. Wearn Haw and
a translator often have to relay information between teammates -- who speak
French, English and Mandarin.
</P>
<P>
If the Chinese can snatch a win or two from the round-robin stages, it will make
life harder for the other challengers.
</P>
<P>
"Foremost on our minds is to go out and get the points," Shosholoza strategist
Ian Ainslie said. "We do expect to win the race and of course you can't take
anything for granted because we haven't raced their boat yet.
</P>
<P>
"But even going out there on Monday, it suddenly hit me it was quite special
that the America's Cup was going to start. After the start I suppose it will be
business as usual," the three-time Olympian said.
</P>
<P>
Both Chaoyang and Shosholoza head Salvatore Sarno confirmed this America's Cup
would not be their teams' last.
</P>
<P>
That's encouraging news for the Chinese sailors who are hoping the event will
boost sailing's popularity in China ahead of the 2008 Olympic Games in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"It's exiting because no one has ever done this in China before," trimmer Ming
Feng Teng said through a translator. "We are now known by people in China, which
was never experienced by a sailor before."

Weather makes the most headlines at the America ' s Cup, again
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
VALENCIA, Spain 2007-04-18 23:47:44 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Consistent weather was the reason organizers chose Valencia for the 32nd
America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
They just didn't expect it to make the most headlines -- for the wrong reasons --
this early on.
</P>
<P>
Light winds canceled sailing in the Louis Vuitton Cup for the third straight day
on Wednesday and team meteorologists said the outlook wouldn't improve before
Saturday, meaning another two full days of racing were likely to be
lost.
</P>
<P>
If that's the case, teams will have to make up eight races -- on top of losing
Friday's reserve day -- before the end of the second stage of round-robins on May
6.
</P>
<P>
Still, sailing crews didn't seem to mind or, at least, appear not
to.
</P>
<P>
"We don't really feel disappointed, because we really don't want to race in
these extremely light conditions," BMW Oracle Racing tactician Gavin Brady said.
"After three years of development, we don't want to let it all come down to a
lottery. We are here to race, but we want to race in good conditions."
</P>
<P>
A cold weather front that swept across Spain's Mediterranean coast last month
has stuck around thanks to high pressure systems over northern Europe that have
brought summer-like temperatures to cities such as London and Budapest.
Meanwhile, Valencia soaked up its wettest spring in 50 years with average
temperatures hovering around 10 degrees (50 F).
</P>
<P>
In New Zealand four years ago, the start of the round-robin, quarterfinal and
semifinal stages of the Louis Vuitton Cup were canceled due to excessive winds.
Forty percent of scheduled race days were not sailed due to excess or lack of
wind in Auckland, with eight straight days being the most in one
stretch.
</P>
<P>
Louis Vuitton Act 13 fleet racing finished this month with disruptions to the
schedule, and despite the halts to the challengers' series, most of the teams
accept its part of the game.
</P>
<P>
"There's no point putting a gloss on it, they're all pro sailors and they've all
been here before and if there's no wind, there's no wind," Emirates Team New
Zealand meteorologist Tom Addis said.
</P>
<P>
Addis added the meteorologists aren't quite so happy about getting their
forecasts right this week.
</P>
<P>
"We don't make the weather, it's our job to predict it and, especially in yacht
racing, you're predicting tiny little subtleties in the flows," Addis said. "If
you can call correctly and people go out with the right mind set of racing being
marginal today, then you've done your job. (But) it's much more interesting for
us to be in racing conditions."
</P>
<P>
Weather patterns in Valencia over the past nine years marked the average wind
speed at 7 nautical miles, the minimum needed to sail a race, while wind gusts
were erratic over the same period. Could miring the teams in these conditions
have given defending champion Alinghi, which will sail in stable, predictable
conditions from June 23-July 4, an advantage?
</P>
<P>
Addis doubts it.
</P>
<P>
"The good teams will generally come to the top, but I think there is going to be
plenty of racing in similar conditions to late June or July when the Cup is
held," the Australian said. "It's nothing you can do anything about anyway, they
set the rules and here we are, so let's race."

Australian authorities puzzled over missing yacht crew

<TEXT>
<P>
A 12-meter (40-foot) catamaran found drifting off Australia's Great Barrier Reef
had engines and computers running and food on the table, but no crew, officials
said Friday after launching a massive search for the missing
men.
</P>
<P>
A coastal patrol aircraft spotted the vessel, named Kaz II, on Wednesday but
rescue workers only reached the boat early Friday, confirming there was no one
aboard.
</P>
<P>
Officials said they were puzzled by what they found.
</P>
<P>
"They got on board and said the engine was running, the computers were running,
there was a laptop set up on the table which was running, the radio was working
... and there was food and utensils set on the table ready to eat, but no sign
of the crew," said Jon Hall, a spokesman for Queensland state's Emergency
Management office.
</P>
<P>
"It was a bit strange," he said.
</P>
<P>
The vessel's emergency beacon and three life jackets were still on
board.
</P>
<P>
Queensland police confirmed that three men were missing, and that a massive sea
and air search was under way Friday from Airlie Beach to the northeastern city
of Townsville.
</P>
<P>
Ten planes and two helicopters were searching an area spanning some 700 nautical
miles, along with four volunteer rescue boats, police and maritime officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Marine police were also towing the vessel back to shore for further
investigation.
</P>
<P>
The men had set out from Airlie Beach on Sunday, and were planning to sail
around northern Australia to Western Australia state, according to Sharon
Davidson of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority.
</P>
<P>
Greg Connor, a forecaster with the Bureau of Meteorology, said the sailors would
have faced moderate southeasterly winds of about 35 kph (22 mph), typical
weather for this time of year.
</P>
<P>
"It would have been excellent sailing conditions," he said. "There's no reason
to believe this is a weather related incident."

EU nations approve new EU frontier rapid reaction teams to stem flow of African migrants
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LUXEMBOURG 2007-04-20 12:44:30 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
European Union nations on Friday agreed to set up rapid reaction teams to try
and keep illegal migrants from entering southern Europe.
</P>
<P>
German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, who chaired a meeting of justice
and interior ministers, said they also backed plans for permanent joint patrols
in late May in the Mediterranean and off Europe's and Africa's Atlantic
coasts.
</P>
<P>
"Citizens expect Europe to provide effective protection of its common external
borders," Schaeuble said. She called the decisions, which will be finalized over
the coming months, "vital measures to counter illegal migration."
</P>
<P>
The decisions add to the measures the 27-nation bloc has already taken to help
southern members Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece cope with thousands of often
poor and desperate African migrants trying to sneak into Europe.
</P>
<P>
Spain and Italy have pleaded with their EU counterparts to send boats, personnel
and planes to try to stem the flow and rescue migrants on the high seas, many of
whom set off on their dangerous voyage for Europe in rickety old
boats.
</P>
<P>
Officials said an initial 450-strong rapid reaction intervention team of
immigration experts and border guards will be set up by the EU's external
borders agency Frontex in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
The agency will be responsible for deploying teams within days to any member
state whose borders are under a particular threat by illegal
migration.
</P>
<P>
The officers on the teams will enjoy legal powers to take immediate decisions in
either processing asylum seekers or ensuring their return to their home
country.
</P>
<P>
Officials added they were happy that Frontex would now have at its disposal 27
helicopters, 116 boats, and 21 airplanes donated from EU countries to conduct
permanent patrols.
</P>
<P>
EU Justice and Home Affairs Commissioner Franco Frattini has urged EU nations to
come to the aid of Spain and Italy.
</P>
<P>
Officials have said Spain, Italy, Germany, Finland and Greece had so far donated
the bulk of the requested material and personnel.
</P>
<P>
EU ministers on Thursday also discussed backing their patrols with a satellite
surveillance system to better monitor the borders.
</P>
<P>
Frontex and Spanish officials have said that for the first three months of the
year increased EU patrols off the West African coast and repatriation and
cooperation deals with African countries had seen the number of migrants
arriving in the Canary Islands plunge to 1,905 from 4,498 for the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 immigrants were intercepted last year while sailing from Africa
to the Canary Islands in small, crowded boats, and officials in the islands say
more than 500 died along the way.

Pan Am Games big test for Brazil ' s future as sporting venue
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SAO PAULO, Brazil 2007-05-02 17:35:04 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Latin America's largest nation prepares to host the Pan American Games in
July, Brazilians are crossing their fingers, hoping the event will go off
without major problems so the country stays on track as a potential host for the
2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The hemisphere-wide Olympic-style Pan Am Games in Rio de Janeiro are seen as a
huge test for Brazil to prove it is capable of hosting major international
sporting events.
</P>
<P>
Preparations haven't gone smoothly, with severe construction delays and cost
overruns. While organizers say everything will be ready in time and insist the
competition will be a success, Rio has seen repeated waves of gang
violence.
</P>
<P>
Brazil also has experienced major air traffic control problems causing periodic
mass flight cancellations and delays, and even the possibility of an outbreak of
dengue fever is a concern as 5,500 athletes from 42 countries compete July
13-29.
</P>
<P>
"From what I hear it's not looking good right now," soccer great Pele told local
media last week. "Unfortunately, there is a high possibility the stadiums won't
be ready in time. That wouldn't be a good visiting card."
</P>
<P>
Soccer officials guarantee that Brazil's chances of hosting the World Cup won't
be affected even if this year's event is plagued by problems, but the Pan Am
organizers say they know preparations are crucial -- and promise they will
deliver.
</P>
<P>
"The Games are being planned so they will improve Rio de Janeiro's ability to
host high-profile international events," said Carlos Roberto Osorio,
secretary-general of Rio's Pan American Games organizing committee. "They will
serve as a test for Brazil as it aspires to host the World Cup and the Olympic
Games in the future."
</P>
<P>
About 15,000 police will be deployed to protect the athletes, journalists and
officials during the Games, but Rio is prone to sudden outbreaks of violence
that are difficult for authorities to control in an urban area where teeming
slums controlled by drug gangs loom next to well-heeled beach
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
Just weeks ago, residents dived for cover and shielded their children as rival
gangs shot at each other and police in violence that killed 20 suspected
criminals.
</P>
<P>
Dengue fever has become a concern with nearly 5,000 cases reported in Rio de
Janeiro alone this year. The mosquito-borne tropical disease causes severe
headaches and joint pain but usually is not fatal.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 health agents have been working in the city to avoid a new
dengue epidemic like the one that claimed at least 50 lives and infected more
than 160,000 across Brazil in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Although air travel woes have eased in recent months, it likely will remain a
concern as athletes, journalists and visitors try to reach Rio.
</P>
<P>
The problems began last year when Brazil's flagship airline Varig nearly
disintegrated under crushing debt, causing mass flight cancellations. Earlier
this year, thousands of flights from major airports were severely delayed due to
problems with the nation's air traffic control system and a strike by traffic
controllers.
</P>
<P>
Even if the Games don't go off perfectly, however, soccer officials remain
confident that FIFA will choose Brazil for the 2014 World Cup. It is the only
nation bidding for the tournament guaranteed to South America. The announcement
is expected in November.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian soccer confederation "hopes the Pan American Games are a success,
of course, but that would not help Brazil in its bid for the World Cup, just as
a disastrous Games would not hurt Brazil's chances either," CBF spokesman
Rodrigo Paiva said. "The World Cup is much different. It involves much
more."
</P>
<P>
All that FIFA wants is assurance that Brazil can meet its list of requirements,
Paiva said.
</P>
<P>
Brazil already has spent seven times more than originally projected on the Pan
American Games. Federal, state and municipal governments have splurged more than
3.2 billion reals (US$1.6 billion; euro1.2 billion), compared to a 2002 budget
of 409 million reals (US$202 million; euro148 million), according to local
media.
</P>
<P>
Sports Minister Orlando Silva Junior told the Folha de S. Paulo newspaper
recently that "it was a grave lapse in planning." But organizers said the budget
had to be revised after federal, state and city authorities decided to upgrade
the Games to meet Olympic standards in areas such as technology and
security.
</P>
<P>
With less than three months before the opening ceremony, workers are racing to
prepare the Joao Havelange Olympic stadium, the Maracanazinho indoor arena and
other sports complexes across the city.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a judicial dispute between a government agency and Games
organizers jeopardized the sailing competition. A court stopped construction at
the venue because a the government claimed it could permanently change a
national park.
</P>
<P>
Pan American Games officials later decided to use temporary structures at the
venue, assuring the competition will take place.
</P>
<P>
Besides Rio, other cities that have expressed interest in staging the 2016
Olympics include Chicago, Madrid, Prague, Rome and Tokyo. The International
Olympic Committee will chose in October 2009.
</P>
<P>
"If Rio wants the Olympic Games, it really needs to make a positive impact with
the Pan American Games," said Ed Hula, editor of Around the Rings, a global news
organization devoted to the Olympics. "They won't have to be perfect, or the
best ever, but they will have to run smoothly."

BMW Oracle beats Luna Rossa to stay top of Louis Vuitton Cup
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
VALENCIA, Spain 2007-05-04 14:17:05 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BMW Oracle Racing took over sole possession of first place in the Louis Vuitton
Cup standings Friday by beating Italian syndicate Luna Rossa in the fifth flight
of round-robin sailing.
</P>
<P>
Both yachts crossed the starting line even before the Italians crossed to port,
a move which gave them a small lead around the first upwind marker.
</P>
<P>
The Americans circled the left buoy before gybing to a right-hand course, and a
strong wind shift made up for the sloppy move as the USA-98 yacht held the
Italians off on port for a 13-second lead around the final marker on the
northern "Romeo" course.
</P>
<P>
Skipper Chris Dickson controlled the port layline to the finish and capped a
third straight come-from-behind win, beating Luna Rossa by 19
seconds.
</P>
<P>
BMW Oracle Racing leads the standings with 29 points, two more than Luna Rossa,
which lost to the Americans for the second time in round-robin
racing.
</P>
<P>
Emirates Team New Zealand moved closer to second by beating fourth-place Desafio
Espanol by 43 seconds on the southern "Juliet" course.
</P>
<P>
The Kiwis held the advantage despite an even start, winning a tacking-duel up
the first leg on starboard, where the wind was stronger, then held the course
for the victory.
</P>
<P>
Emirates Team New Zealand, which sails against Shosholoza of South Africa in the
sixth flight later, improved to 26 points. The Spanish team, which sails against
China Team, stays with 21.
</P>
<P>
Victory Challenge of Sweden moved a point behind Desafio Espanol in the race for
the fourth and final Louis Vuitton Cup semifinals spot with a win over United
Internet Team Germany by 1:18 on "Romeo."
</P>
<P>
The Swedish will race +39 Challenge of Italy next, which lost to Mascalzone
Latino by 2:07, a win that gave Mascalzone Latino 16 points.
</P>
<P>
Mascalzone Latino will re-sail its fourth-flight match against Desafio Espanol
on Saturday if the scheduled seventh flight goes ahead.
</P>
<P>
The Naples-based team breached rules by altering its rigging configuration
during the match race, resulting in a euro10,000 (US$13,560) fine and a re-sail.
It is the team's third breach of the rules.
</P>
<P>
Shosholoza took advantage of a pre-start penalty to the Chinese on "Juliet" to
win by 2:01 and match Mascalzone Latino on points.
</P>
<P>
Also on "Romeo," French syndicate Areva Challenge returns from a fifth-flight
bye to race Luna Rossa.
</P>
<P>
BMW Oracle Racing has a sixth-flight bye.
</P>
<P>
The Louis Vuitton Cup will decide which of the 11 challengers will sail against
America's Cup champion Alinghi in the finals from June 23-July
4.

Mascalzone Latino happy to re-sail after losing jury protest

<TEXT>
<P>
Mascalzone Latino will re-sail its Louis Vuitton Cup match race against Desafio
Espanol after it broke the rules.
</P>
<P>
For the Naples-based syndicate, a re-sail is much better than getting thrown out
of the America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
"The judgment could be seen as lenient," Mascalzone Latino mastman George
Skuodas said Friday. "It's slightly gone in our favor on balance, so we've
probably gotten a little bit lucky."
</P>
<P>
Mascalzone Latino altered the configuration of its backstay on the final lap of
its fourth-flight victory over Desafio Espanol on Wednesday, its third breach of
the America's Cup class rules.
</P>
<P>
The Italian team was fined euro10,000 (US$13,560) and had the two points from
its 35-second win deducted from its round-robin points total. The race was
rescheduled to follow the seventh flight of challengers series sailing on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We were satisfied that this was inadvertent and had no outcome on the match,"
said Bryan Williams, the chairman of the jury. "If the penalty had been more
severe they would have lost their points but for now (the points) are theirs to
lose when they race again."
</P>
<P>
Previously, the Italian entry didn't measure its boat at the right place, and it
was fined euro10,000 (US$13,560) on Monday for using a different paint on its
ITA-99 yacht than is allowed.
</P>
<P>
Williams said that past infractions didn't weigh on the jury's
decision.
</P>
<P>
"It was our fault, we didn't revise the rules close enough as we've been sailing
with that for months," Skuodas said. "As a team we've taken it on the chin and
we'll re-sail the race."
</P>
<P>
The Spanish were one of the teams that caught on to the ITA-99 yacht's
changes.
</P>
<P>
"One of our guys spotted it during the race so as soon as we finished the race
we knew what to look for on video," Desafio Espanol helmsman Karol Jablonski
said.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish wanted Mascalzone Latino eliminated from the race and the points
added to its tally, a request Williams said was unwarranted since the breach
happened on the final lap with the Italians owning a comfortable
lead.
</P>
<P>
"We respect and accept the decision of the jury," Jablonski said.

Boat with Haitian migrants capsizes in shark-infested waters; hundreds attempt risky trip
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SOUTH DOCK, Turks and Caicos Islands 2007-05-04 19:59:33 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hundreds of Haitians set off from their impoverished country each year in
rickety boats, hoping to survive the dangerous voyage, evade Coast Guard cutters
and find a better life on U.S. shores.
</P>
<P>
The perils of the crossing again became gruesomely apparent Friday when a vessel
packed with some 150 people capsized, flinging migrants into shark-infested
waters.
</P>
<P>
Hours after the sailing vessel overturned in the moonlit waters a half-mile
(less than a kilometer) off the Turks and Caicos Islands, rescuers found more
than a dozen bodies -- some with savage bite wounds -- and were still searching
for about 60 missing migrants.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers from the Turks and Caicos and the U.S. Coast Guard recovered 73
survivors, said Coast Guard Petty Officer 3rd Class Barry Bena. The Coast Guard
sent a cutter and a C-130 aircraft to join the search, and survivors were taken
to a detention center on the island of Providenciales in the British
territory.
</P>
<P>
An Associated Press reporter saw bodies, some with missing feet and limbs, that
were fished out of the water and taken to the port of South Dock.
</P>
<P>
"We have 17 confirmed dead," said a harried Turks and Caicos government official
who would not be identified because she was not authorized to speak on the
record. "Five or six small boats of ours are out searching. The survivors are
being fed."
</P>
<P>
Near dawn, the Coast Guard helicopter reported that it spotted about 20 dead
migrants. Exactly how many people died was still unclear, because some bodies
may have drifted before they could be recovered.
</P>
<P>
It could be the deadliest boat disaster in years for Haitian migrants, who
travel on tightly packed vessels. The 150 people tossed into the sea Friday were
on a boat only about 25 feet (7.6 meters) long.
</P>
<P>
"When it's done that way it takes almost nothing for a disaster to occur," Bena
said in a telephone interview from Miami. "A strong wind, or a sea swell, or
people moving around can capsize a boat in an instant."
</P>
<P>
From Oct. 1 through April 30, the Coast Guard intercepted 976 Haitians at sea --
slightly higher than the 950 intercepted during the same period a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
The numbers show that Haitians are still desperate to flee their impoverished
country a year after democracy was restored with the election of President Rene
Preval. Preval replaced an interim government that took over after a bloody
rebellion ousted then-President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 2004. Some 3,229
Haitians were intercepted during that turbulent year.
</P>
<P>
Preval, who is hugely popular among Haiti's poor majority, has teamed with U.N.
peacekeepers to crack down on gangs blamed for a kidnapping epidemic, and is
seeking foreign investment to help lift the nation from poverty.
</P>
<P>
But Haiti is still mired in economic struggles and political instability that
fuel attempts to reach the United States, said Jean-Robert Lafortune, chairman
of the Haitian-American Grassroots Coalition in Florida.
</P>
<P>
Friday's tragedy underscored "one of the greatest fears that we always have in
the community," he said: "knowing that many of those refugees do not make it in
their attempt to make the Florida shore."
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard said the migrant vessel had overturned while being towed by a
Turks and Caicos police boat at 4:30 a.m., but local authorities said the police
boat arrived on the scene only after it capsized.
</P>
<P>
In February an estimated 50 Haitian migrants were lost at sea after a fuel tank
exploded and set their fiberglass boat ablaze off the Dominican Republic. Two
survivors were rescued by an American yacht.

Emirates Team New Zealand clinched a place in the semifinals of the Louis
Vuitton Cup on Sunday with a victory over China Team.
</P>
<P>
A split tack start had the Kiwis sailing on the left on the northern "Romeo"
course where it built up a lead that would never be threatened by the last-place
Chinese. The Kiwis won by 3 minutes, 2 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Emirates Team New Zealand joins American entry BMW Oracle Racing and Italian
syndicate Luna Rossa in the last four. BMW Oracle Racing and Luna Rossa clinched
their places with victories in the seventh flight on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Leader BMW Oracle Racing stayed at the top of the America's Cup challengers
series round-robin standings with 33 points after beating +39 Challenge of Italy
by 53 seconds on the southern "Juliet" course.
</P>
<P>
Emirates Team New Zealand moved one point above idle Luna Rossa into second
place on 32 points.
</P>
<P>
Fourth-place Desafio Espanol moved to within a win of clinching the final spot
in the semifinals, which run from May 14-24, by beating United Internet Team
Germany on "Romeo" by 1:08.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish, which trail Luna Rossa by two points after moving to 29 points,
stayed five ahead of fifth-place Victory Challenge of Sweden with three matches
to sail after the Swedes won a duel against French syndicate Areva Challenge on
"Juliet" by 35 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Desafio Espanol can clinch the last semifinal spot with a win over Victory
Challenge in their ninth-flight match race on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish win eliminated Mascalzone Latino, which saw its America's Cup hopes
end after Shosholoza of South Africa came from behind to beat the Italian team
at the finish line.
</P>
<P>
The Italians earned a penalty after failing to keep clear of the South Africans
in the pre-start, which was more cramped than usual due to a large number of
spectator boats.
</P>
<P>
Shosholoza's RSA-83 boat stayed on the hip of the ITA-99 yacht before a problem
with the spinnaker on the final lap opened up a gap for Mascalzone Latino. The
Italians chose to perform their penalty turn at the pin end of the finish line
and couldn't get around in time as Shosholoza sailed past for the six-second
win.
</P>
<P>
The Louis Vuitton Cup will decide which of the 11 challengers will sail against
America's Cup champion Alinghi in the finals from June 23-July
4.

Luna Rossa, Desafio Espanol win in Louis Vuitton Cup semifinals
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
VALENCIA, Spain 2007-05-16 18:29:47 UTC

<TEXT>
<P>
Luna Rossa is controlling the start box, and with it BMW Oracle
Racing.
</P>
<P>
The Italian syndicate again dominated the Americans in the run-up to the
starting gun and held on to take a 2-1 lead in the best-of-nine Louis Vuitton
Cup semifinals.
</P>
<P>
"Each day is different and you have to race as the conditions dictate," Luna
Rossa helmsman James Spithill said.
</P>
<P>
In the other semifinal series, Desafio Espanol won the pre-start for the first
time against Emirates Team New Zealand and held on to win its first race by
1:14. The Kiwis still lead 2-1.
</P>
<P>
Luna Rossa tactician Torben Grael took advantage of the relatively calm waters
Wednesday, just as he did in much more erratic wind conditions
Monday.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, BMW Oracle Racing's late surge on the final downwind lap saw the
American team win in a near photo-finish, a disappointing turn of events for
Luna Rossa, which has led around every marker in the series.
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday was a tough one to swallow, but you're never gonna change the result
-- it is what it is," Spithill said. "It's really satisfying to see the boys step
up to the challenge (today). They delivered."
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Spithill controlled the pre-start duel with BMW Oracle Racing
skipper Chris Dickson, pinning the USA-98 yacht to the left as the ITA-94 yacht
held the right after coming in on starboard.
</P>
<P>
"When you are on the right with good separation after a split-tack start, you
are bound to make good gains," BMW Oracle Racing navigator Peter Isler said.
"They played it much more conservative, as you might have expected after what
happened yesterday."
</P>
<P>
The Americans were faster on the downwind leg just as they had been throughout
the series, making up five seconds going around the third marker as Spithill
shadowed his Kiwi counterpart.
</P>
<P>
But the advantage was too much to make up as the Italian syndicate led around
the final marker and Spithill held the USA-98 yacht off for the 31-second
win.
</P>
<P>
"We're still pretty happy with the way we sailed for the most part," BMW Oracle
Racing strategist Eric Doyle said. "They sailed as the conditions
dictated."
</P>
<P>
Emirates Team New Zealand played catch-up from the beginning after earning a
pre-start penalty, and a strong right-hand breeze was enough to push the speedy
Spanish boat back into the series.
</P>
<P>
"We worked really hard to stay with the left and control the race, but the wind
the wind went to the right quicker than we anticipated," Emirates Team New
Zealand helmsman Dean Barker said.
</P>
<P>
Desafio Espanol celebrated by waving a Spanish flag from the deck of the ESP-97
boat in front of a large spectator fleet, with many sporting the lime-green
colors of the Spanish team.
</P>
<P>
"I think all if Spain is happy. It was a great day," Desafio Espanol helmsman
Karol Jablonski said. "We were in control and I was trying to keep control ...
we know how difficult it can be to beat a top team and we are happy to be back
in the game -- 1-2 is better than 3-0."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Desafio Espanol and BMW Oracle Racing were issued new measurement
certificates after performing boat alterations before the start Wednesday's
sailing.
</P>
<P>
The two teams have struggled with upwind boat speed in comparison to quick
downwind performances throughout the semifinals of the America's Cup challengers
series.
</P>
<P>
The semifinal winners will meet in the June 1-11 Louis Vuitton Cup, with the
winner advancing to sail against defending champion Alinghi in the America's Cup
from June 23-July 4.
</P>
<P>
The fourth flight of the match racing series is scheduled for
Friday.

Residents in China ' s Olympic sailing city fight demolition plans
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BEIJING 2007-05-17 09:58:44 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dozens of residents in China's coastal Qingdao, host of the 2008 Olympic sailing
events, were holed up in their homes despite power and water cutoffs in a bid to
stop authorities from tearing down their buildings, a farmer-turned-activist and
his lawyer said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Residents of Hexi village in Qingdao's Sifang district were told their homes
would be torn down Friday, although dozens have yet to sign compensation
agreements with the local government, which plans to build new apartments on the
site, said Yuan Bendu, a local farmer whose house was torn down last
month.
</P>
<P>
The standoff echoed an incident in south China's Chongqing city last month, when
developers tore down the home of a couple who had fought eviction for three
years. In that case, the residents and developer reached a settlement, and the
family left willingly.
</P>
<P>
Yuan, 45, said that he and his neighbors clashed with plainclothes police on
March 16 and April 27 that came to protect construction workers as they tore
down five houses in the area.
</P>
<P>
Some residents tried to stop the demolition by standing on the roofs of their
single-story homes and throwing bricks at the workers, he said. Four farmers
were arrested and remain in detention, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the area's 932 households were offered compensation of 3,250 yuan
(US$420 ;euro310) per square meter, which was well below the market value of
about 7,000 yuan per square (US$900;euro670) meter.
</P>
<P>
Qingdao, a popular coastal resort city, is undergoing a massive construction
boom fueled by its being named host of the sailing events for the 2008 Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
Most of the households in Hexi accepted the compensation package because of
pressure and threats, Yuan said, but 82 families have refused to
budge.
</P>
<P>
He said they would try to "hold back" authorities on Friday but would not give
specific details about their plans.
</P>
<P>
"Our lighting and water facilities have been sabotaged by thugs and robbery and
theft cases are happening all the time," Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the local families have lived in the area for generations and grew
vegetables for a living before the city built up around them, making farming
impossible, said Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Li Subin of Beijing's Yitong law firm said he helped the group file paperwork
for a lawsuit against the Sifang District Government on April 23 but that the
Qingdao Intermediate Court refused to accept the case.
</P>
<P>
An administrative officer with the Sifang government said Thursday he was unsure
about the situation in Hexi and referred calls to the local redevelopment
office, where the phone rang unanswered. Like many Chinese officials, he refused
to give his name.
</P>
<P>
Property disputes and illegal land grabs have accelerated recently as China's
economy expands at double-digit rates and farmland is gobbled up for industrial
parks and skyscrapers. Government officials often have sided with developers,
touching off riots and protests.

British sailor rescued at sea by his neighbor

<TEXT>
<P>
Competitive sailor John Fildes traveled a long way to meet a neighbor -- losing
his racing yacht, and almost his life, in the process.
</P>
<P>
Fildes was sailing his 12-meter (40-foot) trimaran to Newport, Rhode Island,
when a storm collapsed his sails and swamped his engine near Bermuda. As he
drifted in the Atlantic, a passing cruise ship responded to his distress call
and took him aboard.
</P>
<P>
The next morning he met the Crown Princess's captain, Alistair Clark, and the
men discovered they live within 1.6 kilometers (one mile) of each other in the
coastal English village of Warsash, Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing was probably fate," Fildes told The Associated Press on
Thursday. "He was there and I was there, and there was absolutely nobody
else."
</P>
<P>
Fildes, 32, set out from St. Maarten on May 9 and ran into trouble during
violent weather the night before his Monday rescue. He had planned to enter the
yacht, Dangerous When Wet, in a race between Newport and Bermuda, but the vessel
has probably been lost at sea.
</P>
<P>
Fildes said he had never met the captain before, but he left a thank you note
inviting him to dinner in Warsash.

It ' s official: Valencia will stage Formula One street race starting in 2008
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
VALENCIA, Spain 2007-06-01 13:57:09 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Valencia will stage the European Grand Prix starting next year after Formula One
chief Bernie Ecclestone signed a seven-year contract with event organizers
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Valencia regional government confirmed that Ecclestone signed the agreement
with Valmor Sport, which owns the rights to organize the street circuit race.
The regional government has a 25 percent stake in the private
business.
</P>
<P>
The agreement to bring a second F1 race to Spain -- after the Spanish GP in
Barcelona -- was originally announced on May 10. Ecclestone said at the time that
the contract would only be signed once the outcome of the regional and municipal
elections were confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Valencia regional President Francisco Camps and Mayor Rita Barbera -- who are
both in the opposition Popular Party and spent two years negotiating the
agreement with Ecclestone -- were re-elected on May 27.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Valmor would pay euro26 million (US$35.17 million) annually to
Ecclestone for the rights to stage the race, an event previously held in
Nuerburgring, Germany. The Valencia race is likely to be held in
August.
</P>
<P>
The street circuit, designed by German racetrack architect Hermann Tilke, will
be based around Valencia's port, which is currently staging the America's Cup
sailing event.

Emirates Team New Zealand takes 2-0 lead over Luna Rossa in Louis Vuitton Cup final
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
VALENCIA, Spain 2007-06-02 17:57:04 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although it took the right-hand side it wanted at the start, Luna Rossa is 2-0
down to Emirates Team New Zealand in the Louis Vuitton Cup final.
</P>
<P>
For the second straight race, Luna Rossa started from the opposite side of its
entry position, and for the second time Emirates Team New Zealand helmsman Dean
Barker controlled the race as a result.
</P>
<P>
Barker did it Saturday before either boat had even crossed the starting
line.
</P>
<P>
"Dean did a great job of keeping his momentum going as we came out of the
dial-up and then making it tough for Luna Rossa to get back to the start line,"
Kiwi strategist Ray Davies said. "Today was awesome, one of the best days we've
had on board."
</P>
<P>
After James Spithill got across the bow of the NZL-92 yacht, Barker pinned him
to the right, forcing the Luna Rossa helmsman to tack as the Italians sped
toward the line too quickly. The Kiwis crossed at full pace.
</P>
<P>
"Rather than jeopardizing our start, we gave (starboard) to them," Emirates Team
New Zealand's Adam Beaschel said.
</P>
<P>
The Kiwis then used a 22-tack duel up the first lap to open up a decisive three
boat-length lead. They then matched the Italian boat's every move throughout the
race to cross the finish 40 seconds in front.
</P>
<P>
"The turning point was the start," Luna Rossa navigator Michele Ivaldi said. "We
wanted to get the right more strongly than yesterday, but Team New Zealand made
us pay for it."
</P>
<P>
In Friday's first flight, Emirates Team New Zealand hung on for an eight-second
win after Spithill gave up the right-hand advantage to Barker at the
start.
</P>
<P>
Luna Rossa was off the line in front in every race in the 5-1 semifinal win over
BMW Oracle Racing.
</P>
<P>
"We haven't got it quite right so far, but we are confident in our weather team
and we trust their suggestions," Ivaldi said. "I think we sailed as well as we
could against the enemy we were sailing."
</P>
<P>
Emirates Team New Zealand rounded the first marker, which was busy with dolphins
when boats weren't near, with a 25-second advantage.
</P>
<P>
Only once in 15 challengers series matches since the end of the round-robin
stages has the leading team around the first marker failed to win the race. That
was when BMW Oracle Racing overtook Luna Rossa on the final lap.
</P>
<P>
Despite using fresh sails after the series win over the Americans, the Italians
found it hard to rally on the even-weather course that the 250-strong spectator
fleet made choppier than usual.
</P>
<P>
Barker also had more confidence than Friday, when a few nervy gybes almost let
the Italians back in.
</P>
<P>
"The conditions today made it harder for the boat behind," Beaschel said. "Days
like this definitely make it more intense in the starting box. They (Luna Rossa)
kept it as close as they could."
</P>
<P>
The Kiwis are three wins away from clinching the best-of-nine series. The winner
sails against defending champion Alinghi in the America's Cup, which begins June
23.
</P>
<P>
Luna Rossa isn't panicking despite Spithill's inability to get across the line
in front again.
</P>
<P>
"He's been getting the sides we've wanted, so as far as we're concerned, James
has been sailing well," Luna Rossa trimmer Joe Newton said.

Former U.S. President Bush arrives in Greece for cruise holiday
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ATHENS, Greece 2007-06-04 09:27:19 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former U.S. President George H.W. Bush arrived in Greece on Monday for a sailing
holiday around the Greek islands as a guest of a shipping tycoon.
</P>
<P>
The former president landed early Monday in Athens and changed planes for
Kavala, a port city in northeastern Greece, where he arrived shortly after 11
a.m. (0800GMT). He is expected to visit the northern islands Thassos, Limnos and
Samos during a tour expected to last at least a week.
</P>
<P>
Bush is a guest of Greek shipping tycoon Spiros Latsis, on whose yacht he has
also vacationed in the past. Latsis, who ranks 55th on the most recent Forbes
list of the world's richest people, has frequently offered his luxurious vessel
to other prominent visitors -- including Britain's Prince Charles and Camilla,
the Duchess of Cornwall, during their honeymoon two years ago and to Camilla
again last month.
</P>
<P>
Bush is accompanied by a party of 19, including his son Jeb Bush, the former
governor of Florida.
</P>
<P>
The 41st U.S. President, who served from 1989-93, is the father of current U.S.
President George W. Bush -- who arrives separately in Europe today for an
eight-day, six-country trip that will include the annual summit of the Group of
Eight industrialized nations in Germany.

7th and possibly decisive America ' s Cup race postponed due to light wind
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
VALENCIA, Spain 2007-07-01 14:28:46 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Swiss will have to put the bubbly on ice.
</P>
<P>
The seventh and possibly series-clinching race of the America's Cup was
postponed Sunday because of light winds, and will be held on Tuesday
instead.
</P>
<P>
Alinghi, from landlocked Switzerland, leads the challengers from New Zealand 4-2
in the best-of-nine series which has been the most closely contested in 24
years.
</P>
<P>
The seventh flight was pushed to the next scheduled race day, Tuesday, to the
ire of the enormous spectator fleet and the nearly 100,000 people who had passed
through the turnstiles of Port America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss had the momentum going into the seventh race.
</P>
<P>
Brad Butterworth, the cagey skipper looking to clinch his fourth consecutive
Auld Mug, guided the SUI-100 to three straight wins coming into the seventh
race, including back-to-back comebacks over the Kiwis.
</P>
<P>
But afternoon clouds didn't help the already soft breeze as both boats wadded in
the light swell, the sailors' munching on sandwiches and patiently waiting until
race officials called it a day.
</P>
<P>
It was a scene reminiscent of the last America's Cup in 2003, when erratic
weather in the Hauraki Gulf off Auckland, New Zealand, meant Alinghi had to wait
an extra day to complete its 5-0 sweep of Team New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The landlocked, alpine nation then chose Valencia as the host for the 32nd
edition because of its consistent weather.
</P>
<P>
The current edition of the event has passed with few weather postponements,
aside from a long delay to start the Louis Vuitton Cup challengers' series in
April, with nearly eight days of sailing lost.
</P>
<P>
The America's Cup is named for its first winner, the U.S. yacht America, in
1851. In its 156-year history, only three regattas have been as closely
contested as this one.

Danish replica Viking ship sets sail for Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ROSKILDE, Denmark 2007-07-01 15:34:51 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 30-meter (100-foot) replica of a Viking longship glided out of Denmark's
Roskilde fjord Sunday, with 65 crew members determined to sail the ship across
the North Sea to Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Ireland's Environment Minister Dick Roche was among the roughly 4,000 people
watching the Sea Stallion of Glendalough begin the attempt to relive the
perilous journey its Viking forebear made some 1,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The ship is billed as the world's biggest and most ambitious Viking ship
reconstruction. It was modeled after a warship excavated in 1962 from the
Roskilde fjord after being buried in the seabed for nearly 950
years.
</P>
<P>
"The Vikings are coming back. Be prepared," skipper Carsten Hvid shouted before
jumping on board the wooden longship.
</P>
<P>
"You will be very welcome in Dublin on this occasion," Roche
replied.
</P>
<P>
The crew of sailing enthusiasts and history buffs plans to sail the ship on a
1,900-kilometer (1,200-mile) voyage to Dublin, which was founded by Vikings in
the 9th century. The planned arrival date is Aug. 15.
</P>
<P>
The expedition aims to gain a better understanding of the challenges the Vikings
faced on their long journeys. There is no shelter from crashing waves, wind and
rain on the open vessel. The crew have a minimum of privacy in the confined
space.
</P>
<P>
Crew members wearing baseball hats, windbreaker jackets and life vests hugged
family members before boarding the ship.
</P>
<P>
"I am not nervous but there is some funny tickling in my stomach," said crew
member Lasse Rahn, a 21-year-old student from Flensburg, Germany. "I am so
excited."
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Vikings, the crew is aided by modern technology: a GPS satellite
navigation system and radar, and the ship will be accompanied by a modern
support vessel with medical and rescue experts.
</P>
<P>
The goal is to sail nonstop to Dublin by crossing the North Sea and rounding the
northern tip of Scotland. But the plan could change depending on the
weather.
</P>
<P>
"If we get 10 hours of rain and storms, we still need to be able to laugh to
survive," said Claus Oreskov, 46, a Danish crew member. "What all crew members
have in common is that we all are a bit crazy."
</P>
<P>
Using replicas of Viking era tools -- craftsmen built the 7.5-ton (8.3-short ton)
Sea Stallion using 150 cubic meters (5,250 cubic feet) of oak and 7,000
hand-forged iron rivets.
</P>
<P>
The Vikings entered history in the late eighth century, when Christian monks
chronicled the first Norse raids on the coasts of northern Europe. The Vikings
were also skilled craftsmen and traders, establishing commercial networks as far
away as Constantinople -- today's Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
In Britain and Ireland, the raids gradually grew into full-fledged invasions led
by Danish and Norwegian kings. The first Viking settlements in Ireland have been
dated back to 840.

New Zealanders get chance to recharge with weather postponement
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
VALENCIA, Spain 2007-07-02 01:19:11 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trailing 4-2 and one defeat away from losing the America's Cup against Swiss
boat Alinghi, New Zealand needed a break.
</P>
<P>
It got one, although one neither team had in mind. Racing was canceled for the
day when the winds failed, and the seventh and possibly deciding race in the
first-to-five 32nd America's Cup was postponed until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"It's probably a good thing for us to have a break at this stage," New Zealand
strategist Ray Davies said. "It gives us time for reflection, to bounce back and
come out firing on Tuesday."
</P>
<P>
For the Swiss, just one win away from repeating their 2003 triumph, it mean
putting their champagne celebrations on ice.
</P>
<P>
"It's not a big deal to wait a couple of days," said Grant Simmer, design team
coordinator for the Swiss. "We've been waiting three or four years for this, so
we can wait a day."
</P>
<P>
New Zealand won the cup in 1995 and successfully defended it in 2000, only to
lose it 5-0 to Alinghi in 2003, making the Swiss the first European crew to ever
claim the cup.
</P>
<P>
Now the Kiwis see the Swiss foaming through the sea like a specter from four
years past.
</P>
<P>
Although the series is already one of the four closest in the regatta's 156-year
history, Alinghi has won three straight, overcoming a 2-1 deficit for a 4-2 lead
in the best-of-nine match-race series. The Kiwis now need three straight
themselves to bring the oldest trophy in international sport, the Auld Mug, back
to Auckland.
</P>
<P>
Davies said the two-day break might cool the Swiss momentum, and mentally
recharge his Emirates Team New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, there is a little advantage to Emirates Team New Zealand here," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Physically, Davies said, the New Zealanders are in good shape, since light winds
do little to tax their strength, even for those with the heaviest job on job,
the burly winch grinders.
</P>
<P>
"Mentally, it's better," he said about the benefits of two days without racing.
"It's been some pretty long days out there."
</P>
<P>
While the delay forced the Swiss to put aside their bubbly, it also deprived
Grant Dalton, the head of the New Zealand team, of the birthday present he
wanted most when he turned 50 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"It would have been huge for him to get a win in today," Davies
said.
</P>
<P>
Even before the regatta is settled, Spanish team Desafio Espanol appears poised
to throw down the gauntlet for the 33rd America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the first team declaring that it wants a shot at the cup, known
as the "Challenger of Record," does so as soon as the final race is decided. And
top Spanish sailing officials met key figures from Alinghi and Valencia on
Sunday, fueling speculation that a Spanish challenge was imminent.
</P>
<P>
Landlocked, Switzerland chose Valencia as the host for the 32nd edition because
of its consistent weather. The current series has suffered few weather-related
delays, aside from a long delay to start the Louis Vuitton Cup challengers'
series in April, with nearly eight days of sailing lost.

A replica of the sleek yacht that started it all, New York schooner America,
glided into the America's Cup harbor on Monday, lending its sense of history to
the race for the oldest trophy in international sports.
</P>
<P>
Not all the winning yachts of sailing's highest profile regatta have enjoyed the
same reverence, sometimes facing ignoble golden years as anything from floating
fuel dumps to firewood.
</P>
<P>
The original America, inspired by New York's fast pilot boats, trounced 14 of
Britain's fastest yachts in an 1851 race around the Isle of Wight, taking home a
trophy that still bears its name.
</P>
<P>
That yacht was destroyed when its storage shed collapsed under heavy snow in
1942. In 1967, a full-scale replica was built by the Goudy and Stephen shipyard
in Maine, and has sailed since.
</P>
<P>
America is as striking now as it was in 1851, when Britain's Queen Victoria
noted that "she is very pretty." The 100-foot (30.85 meter) ship has a gleaming
dark hull, polished woodwork and masts, and, with its luxurious appointments,
has more in common with the superyachts sharing this harbor than the
stripped-down modern racers nearby.
</P>
<P>
Exactly 100 of those new carbon-fibred 80-foot America's Cup Class boats have
been built under the latest design rules from 1983, including the Swiss and Kiwi
yachts currently skirmishing at sea.
</P>
<P>
They are designed for speed, and speed only.
</P>
<P>
"They are super exotic and require huge amounts of muscle power," said Marcus
Hutchinson, media director for the America's Cup organizers. "They are not very
practical."
</P>
<P>
Swiss defender Alinghi leads the challenger Emirates Team New Zealand 4-2 in a
best-of-nine series, with the seventh race scheduled for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Older versions of the latest generation boats often end up with teams hoping to
challenge for future America's Cups. Some are charter boats giving guests a
taste of top-level sailing.
</P>
<P>
Two Australian yachts of the design had strikingly different fates. In 1995,
AUS35 sank while trying to qualify for the cup off San Diego, while its
predecessor Australia II has a place of honor in the Western Australian Maritime
Museum after defeating U.S. defender Liberty in 1983 to end the Americans'
132-year cup winning streak.
</P>
<P>
For generations, figuring out what to do with retired America's Cup boats has
been a challenge.
</P>
<P>
"They (often) served the purpose they were built for, and were broken up," said
Hutchinson.
</P>
<P>
For some yachts, that might have been a more noble end.
</P>
<P>
The 1881 success of U.S. defender Mischief -- nicknamed "The Iron Pot" because it
was a then-rare metal hull -- brought short-lived glory. It sailed as a pleasure
yacht until it was bought by the Mayflower Oil Company in 1906 and used as an
oil barge and depot off Boston.
</P>
<P>
Finally, in 1929, it was towed offshore by the U.S. Navy, which attempted to
scuttle it. In its last bit of mischief, Mischief refused to sink, forcing the
U.S. warship Mojave to open fire on it in front of 20 yachts full of horrified
fans who had come to bid farewell to the retired champion.
</P>
<P>
Another winner, Puritan, the successful cup defender in 1885, was put to work as
a freight and passenger ferry between Portugal and the Azores, until it was
scrapped in 1925.
</P>
<P>
The pride of rich owners can also seal the fate of yachts. On his fourth failed
try to win the cup back for Britain, Sir Thomas Lipton was so distraught over
his Shamrock IV losing to American defender Resolute in 1920 that he ordered the
wooden boat chopped into firewood. The remains ended up warming the hearth of
shipyard owner Bob Jacob.
</P>
<P>
But there is hope for successful yachts. Two of the boats that twice
successfully defended the trophy for the U.S. -- Intrepid in 1967 and 1970 and
Courageous in 1974 and 1977 -- are both still sailing.

Danish replica Viking ship heading for Ireland makes stop in Norway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An Ireland-bound replica of a Viking longship has stopped on an island off
Norway where it is awaiting the right wind to cross the North Sea, a crew member
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 30-meter (100-foot) Sea Stallion of Glendalough, billed as the largest
reconstruction of a Viking ship, left Denmark on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
They 65-strong crew sailed nearly 500 kilometers (310 miles) in 33 hours before
deciding to moor on Bragdoeya, a small island off southern Norway, when the
winds died down.
</P>
<P>
Speaking by telephone, crew member Preben Rather Soerensen said the sailors
would continue the journey later Tuesday or Wednesday along the Norwegian coast,
perhaps making another stop in the southwestern city of Stavanger.
</P>
<P>
"The wind and weather decide how, where and when we go," Rather Soerensen said.
"If the wind is right, we may cross (the North Sea) earlier than
planned."
</P>
<P>
The Sea Stallion was modeled after a warship excavated in 1962 from the Roskilde
fjord after being buried in the seabed for nearly 950 years.
</P>
<P>
The expedition aims to gain a better understanding of the challenges the Vikings
faced on their long journeys. There is no shelter from crashing waves, wind and
rain on the open vessel.
</P>
<P>
The crew of sailing enthusiasts and history buffs hopes to complete the
1,900-kilometer (1,200-mile) voyage to Dublin on Aug. 15.
</P>
<P>
Although they had planned to do the journey nonstop, the stop in Norway was a
welcome break for the crew, so they could get some rest and dry their clothes,
Rather Soerensen said.
</P>
<P>
"We have three crew members that got sea sick and bad colds, and one hurt her
knee," he said, adding that all would be able to continue the
journey.
</P>
<P>
"So far, we've had an awesome time with a lot of great wind and lots, lots and
lots of rain," he said.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Vikings, the crew is aided by modern technology: a GPS satellite
navigation system and radar, and the ship will be accompanied by a modern
support vessel with medical and rescue experts.
</P>
<P>
Using replicas of Viking era tools -- craftsmen built the 7.5-ton (8.3-short ton)
Sea Stallion using 150 cubic meters (5,250 cubic feet) of oak and 7,000
hand-forged iron rivets.

Second defeat hurts New Zealand as much as first after photo finish raises false hope
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
VALENCIA, Spain 2007-07-03 19:06:15 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four years after being swept out of the America's Cup, New Zealand didn't think
defeat could hurt as much this time.
</P>
<P>
It did.
</P>
<P>
The Kiwis recovered from a big deficit and a penalty disadvantage over the final
leg Tuesday, only to stutter at the end as Alinghi won a photo finish and the
series-clinching seventh race.
</P>
<P>
Landlocked Switzerland retained the Auld Mug after beating Emirates Team New
Zealand 5-2 in the closest series in 24 years.
</P>
<P>
The last lap brought back memories of Australia II's come-from-behind victory in
1983, when the Australian boat passed Liberty on the last lap to clinch a 4-3
series win, wrestling the Auld Mug from American shores for the first time in
132 years.
</P>
<P>
"All credit to Alinghi ... they just kept on sailing the way they do and beat us
fair and square in the end," Emirates Team New Zealand head Grant Dalton said.
"The guys have done an amazing job. Of course I'm enormously
proud."
</P>
<P>
The penalty earned in a dial-down at the top of the third marker cost the
Kiwis.
</P>
<P>
As Alinghi's spinnaker sail flew out after the wind shifted suddenly on the last
lap, the Kiwis made up over 100 meters (328 feet) to overtake the Swiss shortly
before the finish line.
</P>
<P>
But the NZL-92 yacht lost crucial speed performing the penalty turn and crept
across the finish line inches behind the SUI-100 boat to lose by one
second.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the margin today really matters. They still won it," Dalton
said.
</P>
<P>
After defeat, New Zealand's participation in the next edition hangs in the
balance.
</P>
<P>
Sports Minister Trevor Mallard said the New Zealand government still has to
decide if there will be funding for another challenge.
</P>
<P>
"The government will make a call on that quite soon after the end of the cup,"
Mallard had said.
</P>
<P>
The government contributed around US$26 million after the 5-0 drubbing at the
hands of Alinghi last time around.
</P>
<P>
"We've been focussed on the now," Dalton said. "We'll need a bit of time to look
at what happens next."
</P>
<P>
Emirates Team New Zealand beat Desafio Espanol 5-2 to reach the Louis Vuitton
Cup final, where it routed Italy's Luna Rossa 5-0 to sail in its fourth straight
America's Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't come here to just take part. We came here to win it," Dalton said.
"We haven't done that, so we're just going to have to regroup and have a look at
what the future holds."
</P>
<P>
As the Kiwis gained the lead in the last lap, the roar of New Zealand fans was
deafening as they watched a giant TV in an open-wall building in Port America's
Cup nicknamed the Wool Shed because of its heavy Kiwi numbers.
</P>
<P>
The howling continued after the finish, since the commentary was drowned out and
many believed the Kiwis had crossed the line first.
</P>
<P>
"For a minute there, we thought there was a god of sailing and that he was on
New Zealand's side," said 45-year-old Eric Groothvis from Auckland. "It was
amazing."

Second America ' s Cup win proves Alinghi ' s first success was no fluke
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
VALENCIA, Spain 2007-07-03 20:31:07 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The landlocked Swiss are masters of the ocean.
</P>
<P>
Again.
</P>
<P>
The Alinghi team from Switzerland -- a country more often associated with Alpine
snow-scapes, cheese, chocolate and freshwater lakes -- successfully defended the
coveted America's Cup on Tuesday, beating Emirates Team New Zealand
5-2.
</P>
<P>
"Aside from the birth of my children, (today) is the best day of my life," said
Alinghi owner Ernesto Bertarelli, who created the first Swiss-flagged cup team
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Alinghi took the Auld Mug trophy away from the sailing-proud Kiwis by beating
them 5-0 off Auckland in 2003, and brought it to Europe for the first time in
its more than 150-year history.
</P>
<P>
Bertarelli started the team in 2000, immediately after New Zealand successfully
defended its 1995 cup victory by defeating Italian sailing powerhouse Luna Rossa
5-0.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss biotech billionaire's formula was to set up a smooth, corporate-style
team drawing on the world's best talent. Bertarelli even compared the team to
the nation of Switzerland, in the center of Europe.
</P>
<P>
"We had to be open to other cultures," he said. "We grow bigger through
diversity."
</P>
<P>
And Bertarelli was the only Swiss aboard the boat that won Tuesday -- and even he
was born in Italy. The rest of the winning team was made up of six Kiwis, three
Americans, two Italians, and one each from Canada, the Netherlands, Australia,
and Spain.
</P>
<P>
Bertarelli's recipe for cultural diversity held an explosive ingredient for Kiwi
sailing fans: many of Alinghi's sailors came from New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Alinghi hired six of the key sailors in the Kiwis' 2000 defense of the cup,
including Russell Coutts, who left in 2004, and current skipper Brad
Butterworth.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand fans were outraged, sending hate mail and death threats to Alinghi,
and even setting up a group called BlackHeart to jeer Kiwis who sailed for the
"enemy."
</P>
<P>
The team from the Alps also attracted gentler teasing.
</P>
<P>
"People were laughing at us with our leather shorts, edelweiss, cheese,
chocolate and cuckoo clocks," Bertarelli said about the early
days.
</P>
<P>
Bertarelli, with an MBA from Harvard, said he hopes to turn sailing into a sport
that can be self-sustaining through sponsorship, rather than remaining the
domain of rich enthusiasts.

USS Kitty Hawk, oldest active US warship, visits Sydney on farewell tour
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ABOARD THE USS KITTY HAWK 2007-07-05 06:01:45 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Navy's oldest ship in full active service pulled into Sydney Harbor on
Thursday for a farewell visit, following its final military exercises before
being decommissioned.
</P>
<P>
The USS Kitty Hawk, which is based in the Japanese port city of Yokosuka, and
its crew of more than 5,500 sailors, docked at the Garden Island naval base
along with support ships from its battle group.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of spectators lined foreshores of Australia's biggest city to catch a
glimpse of the massive vessel, as half a dozen television helicopters buzzed
overhead.
</P>
<P>
On board, eager American sailors snapped photos and pointed as the white peaks
of Australia's iconic Opera House came into view.
</P>
<P>
The 46-year-old ship -- the only U.S. aircraft carrier permanently deployed
abroad -- recently took part in Talisman Saber exercises off Australia's
northeast coast that involved more than 30 ships, more than 100 planes and
almost 30,000 U.S. and Australian troops.
</P>
<P>
The ship's current voyage in the western and central Pacific Ocean was expected
to be its last major mission before it is replaced next year by the USS George
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Captain Todd Zecchin said he will mourn the day next year when the USS Kitty
Hawk is sent back to the United States to be decommissioned.
</P>
<P>
"When you're sailing on board a vessel and you go to sea with 5,000 other human
beings and you share that entity and that experience, there really is a bond
there that can't be broken," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"This is our home and this is our way of life, so when you put her to bed for
the last time, it's a big deal and there's a lot of emotion."
</P>
<P>
Commissioned in 1961, the ship played a key role in the early part of the
Vietnam conflict, and was among two carriers in the Persian Gulf that sent
planes to launch the Iraq war in 2003.
</P>
<P>
The diesel-powered ship was deployed to Yokosuka in 1998, and will be replaced
with the nuclear-powered George Washington as part of the U.S. military's effort
to modernize its forces in East Asia -- an area of potential flashpoints with
North Korea or China.
</P>
<P>
The vessel's replacement has sparked a backlash in Japan -- the only country to
suffer a nuclear attack -- where critics oppose the basing of a nuclear-powered
warship in domestic waters. Japan's government says the George Washington would
boost regional stability.

Chinese ship owner, captain get three years jail for polluting ancient Grand Canal
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BEIJING 2007-07-06 12:40:50 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Chinese court sentenced a ship owner and captain to three years in jail for
not preventing an accident that dumped 200 tons of sulfuric acid into the
900-year-old Grand Canal last year, state media said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Yuhang People's Court in east China's Hangzhou city on Wednesday convicted
the cargo ship's owner, Xu Changjun, and the captain, Liu Guanhe, of allowing
their vessel to dump the chemical into the water last August, the official
Xinhua News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The report said the ship had been damaged and repaired a month before the
accident but failed to undergo a required safety check before being put back
into operation.
</P>
<P>
The two men tried to use liquid soap, glue, and iron flakes to patch holes in
the ship when it started to leak and kept sailing until it capsized, it said.
They alerted local authorities only after two thirds of the ship was
underwater.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities were forced to pour 900 tons of liquid alkali into the
waterway to neutralize the acid after the spill.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua said the men were also ordered to pay 23,200 yuan (US$3,050;euro2,250) in
compensation to two downstream fishing companies that suffered economic losses
from the pollution.
</P>
<P>
China's waterways are dangerously polluted after decades of rapid economic
growth and lax enforcement of pollution controls.
</P>
<P>
A quarter of the length of the country's seven main river systems are so
polluted that even touching the water is harmful to skin, the vice minister of
China's State Environmental Protection Agency, Pan Yue, told state media earlier
this week. Seven of the nine major lakes the agency monitors were equally
toxic.

German sailor emulates ancient mariners in trans-Atlantic voyage from New York
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK 2007-07-11 17:12:13 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A German sailor set sail Wednesday from New York, bound for Spain, in a reed
boat designed to replicate ocean voyages that he believes were taking place
12,000 years before Christopher Columbus' famous trip.
</P>
<P>
Dominique Gorlitz, 40, a former teacher from Chemnitz, Germany, said he wants to
prove that ancient mariners could have crossed the Atlantic Ocean in a boat
similar to his 41-foot (12.5-meter) reed-and-eucalyptus craft.
</P>
<P>
The Abora III, named for a Canary Island sun god, cast off from a Manhattan
dock, then was towed toward the Statue of Liberty, where it was to be cut loose
to sail on its own out to sea.
</P>
<P>
The first stop for Gorlitz and 11 companions was to be the Azores, five weeks'
sailing from New York, by Gorlitz's estimate. From there the Abora III would
turn northeast and head for its final stop in Pontevedra, Spain. The entire
voyage was expected to take two months.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to retrace the ancient waterways to prove that prehistoric people
crossed the ocean both ways," Gorlitz said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
His vessel was towed Wednesday to the Statue of Liberty, where crew members
would hoist their sail for the voyage, expected to last two months.
</P>
<P>
Gorlitz's journey mimics the 1947 journey by Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl,
who sailed a balsa wood raft nearly 5,000 miles (8,046 kilometers) from Peru to
Polynesia in 101 days to prove his theory that ancient mariners could have
migrated across vast stretches of ocean.
</P>
<P>
Gorlitz said traces of tobacco and cocaine were found in the tomb of Egypt's
pharaoh Ramses II, evidence of long-distance trans-Atlantic commerce during the
Stone Age. He also believes cave drawings in Spain show that people living
14,000 years ago had an understanding of ocean currents.
</P>
<P>
Scholars have expressed doubt about Gorlitz's assertions.
</P>
<P>
"I wish them well, but for a proper replicative experiment in archaeology, the
culture has to be consistent," said Kenneth L. Feder, an anthropology professor
at Central Connecticut State University and author of "Frauds, Myths, and
Mysteries: Science and Pseudoscience in Archaeology.
</P>
<P>
"How can they replicate the past accurately by using evidence from thousands of
years ago in Egypt and a boat similar to those built 800 years ago in South
America? These are completely different periods," Feder said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
He said there were other possible ways for nicotine and coca to have turned up
in ancient Egypt -- possibly from now-unknown plants in Africa, or even from
"mummy unwrapping parties," popular in 19th century England.
</P>
<P>
"This trip proves that if you are brave and foolhardy you can sail a primitive
boat across the Atlantic, but that's all it proves," Feder said.
</P>
<P>
Gorlitz's boat, partly built by Aymara Indians in Bolivia and assembled at a New
Jersey marina, is based on what Gorlitz says is a North African sketch dating
back thousands of years. It has a crew of 11 in addition to the owner, and will
take advantage of such modern amenities as a GPS satellite navigation
system.
</P>
<P>
Reed boats have been around for centuries in various cultures, and are still
built by Aymara living on Lake Titicaca in the Andes.

China's military has set up a special unit trained to counter threats such as

<P>
The drill Friday in the eastern Chinese seaside city of Qingdao was held in the

"Terrorists" on a motorboat, armed with guns and bombs, simulated taking over an
oil tanker and seizing two hostages. Marine police were dispatched to capture
the fake terrorists, the agency said.

<P>
Qingdao, about 550 kilometers (340 miles) southeast of Beijing, will host the
Olympic sailing competition from Aug. 9 to 21 next year. About 400 athletes will
compete for medals in 11 sailing events.

<P>
Luo Gan, the top law and order official of the Communist Party of China, watched
the exercise Friday and urged public security departments to intensify
anti-terrorist efforts to ensure a safe Olympics.

<P>
"We should take the opportunity of the Olympics to improve security services for
Chinese society," Luo said.
</P>
<P>
State media have reported that plans drawn up in 2005 allocated US$300 million
(euro225 million) for security -- only about 20 percent of the amount spent for
the 2004 Athens Games.

New oil leaks threaten summer beaches on Spain ' s Balearic Island of Ibiza
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MADRID, Spain 2007-07-14 15:03:14 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New oil leaks from a sunken ship were on Saturday threatening to coat beaches
and coves on the Balearic Island of Ibiza, one of Spain's Mediterranean beauty
spots, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Divers had detected fresh oil leaks from a sunken ship after failed attempts to
seal cracks in the wreck, environment director general for the Balearics, Josep
Lliteres, said.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided to try and remove the oil remaining inside the sunken
vessel, rescue service spokeswoman Pilar Tejo said.
</P>
<P>
Cleanup crews had been working in and around the Mediterranean island in an
attempt to mop up an oil spill which began when merchant ship "Don Pedro" hit
rocks and sank on Wednesday with 150 tons of fuel oil and 50 tons of gasoline on
board.
</P>
<P>
The ship had been sailing from Ibiza to the eastern port city of Valencia when
it sank.
</P>
<P>
Divers had tried to seal a crack which by Thursday had created an oil slick 3.5
miles (5.6 kilometers) long and a kilometer (half-mile) wide, Development
Minister Magdalena Alvarez said.
</P>
<P>
Crews from across Spain were dispatched to try to avoid an environmental problem
on the Balearic island just as summer holidays begin. Around 30 tons of oil had
been cleared by Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Three Ibiza beaches -- Talamanca, Ses Figueretes and Platja de Bossa -- were
closed while crews cleaned up the spill.

Replica Viking ship forced to take tow across North Sea
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
COPENHAGEN, Denmark 2007-07-16 15:14:50 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The crew of a replica Viking longship dropped plans to sail across the North Sea
on Monday because of unfavorable winds and decided to take a tow to Orkney, a
spokeswoman for the expedition said.
</P>
<P>
The Sea Stallion of Glendalough, billed as the biggest Viking ship
reconstruction to date, will be towed by a support ship before continuing its
voyage to Dublin, where it is set to arrive on Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
"We have a timetable we have to stick to and the winds are not favorable to us,"
said Mette Busch of the Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde, west of
Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
The initial plan was to travel nonstop from Roskilde to Dublin using only oars
and sails -- like Viking warriors did 1,000 years ago -- but the weather
intervened.
</P>
<P>
Just days after leaving Roskilde on July 1, the 30-meter-long (100-foot-long)
ship was forced to make stops in Norway to await the right winds to cross the
North Sea.
</P>
<P>
After sailing along the Norwegian coast for nearly two weeks, the crew decided
to start the crossing early Monday, but westerly winds made it impossible, Busch
said. The ship would need an easterly wind to push it across the North
Sea.
</P>
<P>
"Vikings didn't have deadlines so they could sail whenever the winds permitted.
They didn't have a reception committee jumping on the harbor in Dublin as we
have," Busch said.
</P>
<P>
The support ship, Cable One, would tow the Sea Stallion to Kirkwall, the biggest
town on Orkney, where it was set to arrive on Tuesday, she said.
</P>
<P>
Busch said the North Sea crossing was not the most important part of the journey
for the Sea Stallion, which was modeled after Viking ship believed to have been
built in 1042 in Glendalough, Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"What is interesting for us is to sail in the waters around Orkney and the Irish
Sea because the original was built to sail there," Busch said.
</P>
<P>
The expedition's goal is to gain a better understanding of the challenges the
Vikings faced on their long journeys.

New Zealanders get chance to recharge with weather postponement
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
VALENCIA, Spain 2007-07-02 01:19:11 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trailing 4-2 and one defeat away from losing the America's Cup against Swiss
boat Alinghi, New Zealand needed a break.
</P>
<P>
It got one, although one neither team had in mind. Racing was canceled for the
day when the winds failed, and the seventh and possibly deciding race in the
first-to-five 32nd America's Cup was postponed until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"It's probably a good thing for us to have a break at this stage," New Zealand
strategist Ray Davies said. "It gives us time for reflection, to bounce back and
come out firing on Tuesday."
</P>
<P>
For the Swiss, just one win away from repeating their 2003 triumph, it mean
putting their champagne celebrations on ice.
</P>
<P>
"It's not a big deal to wait a couple of days," said Grant Simmer, design team
coordinator for the Swiss. "We've been waiting three or four years for this, so
we can wait a day."
</P>
<P>
New Zealand won the cup in 1995 and successfully defended it in 2000, only to
lose it 5-0 to Alinghi in 2003, making the Swiss the first European crew to ever
claim the cup.
</P>
<P>
Now the Kiwis see the Swiss foaming through the sea like a specter from four
years past.
</P>
<P>
Although the series is already one of the four closest in the regatta's 156-year
history, Alinghi has won three straight, overcoming a 2-1 deficit for a 4-2 lead
in the best-of-nine match-race series. The Kiwis now need three straight
themselves to bring the oldest trophy in international sport, the Auld Mug, back
to Auckland.
</P>
<P>
Davies said the two-day break might cool the Swiss momentum, and mentally
recharge his Emirates Team New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, there is a little advantage to Emirates Team New Zealand here," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Physically, Davies said, the New Zealanders are in good shape, since light winds
do little to tax their strength, even for those with the heaviest job on job,
the burly winch grinders.
</P>
<P>
"Mentally, it's better," he said about the benefits of two days without racing.
"It's been some pretty long days out there."
</P>
<P>
While the delay forced the Swiss to put aside their bubbly, it also deprived
Grant Dalton, the head of the New Zealand team, of the birthday present he
wanted most when he turned 50 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"It would have been huge for him to get a win in today," Davies
said.
</P>
<P>
Even before the regatta is settled, Spanish team Desafio Espanol appears poised
to throw down the gauntlet for the 33rd America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the first team declaring that it wants a shot at the cup, known
as the "Challenger of Record," does so as soon as the final race is decided. And
top Spanish sailing officials met key figures from Alinghi and Valencia on
Sunday, fueling speculation that a Spanish challenge was imminent.
</P>
<P>
Landlocked, Switzerland chose Valencia as the host for the 32nd edition because
of its consistent weather. The current series has suffered few weather-related
delays, aside from a long delay to start the Louis Vuitton Cup challengers'
series in April, with nearly eight days of sailing lost.

Louis Vuitton pulls out of sponsoring America ' s Cup

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
French luxury goods giant Louis Vuitton is ending its sponsorship of the
America's Cup, citing concerns that the sailing event has become too
commercial.
</P>
<P>
Vuitton has been a main sponsor of the America's Cup -- international sport's
oldest competition -- since 1983, when the challengers' series became known as
the Louis Vuitton Cup.
</P>
<P>
"The new America's Cup rules define a more commercial approach, and the signed
protocol has already been questioned by some of those concerned. Indeed, there
is a risk of a significant reduction in the number of participating teams," the
company said in a statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
"In these conditions, Louis Vuitton has decided not to lend its name to the next
Challenger selection series," it added.
</P>
<P>
The company held out the possibility, however, that it could return to the cup
"in another form."

Copa America: Brazil and Argentina continue storied rivalry in final
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MARACAIBO, Venezuela 2007-07-13 21:04:57 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Argentina has Brazil right where it wants it -- in the final of the Copa
America.
</P>
<P>
Irked by the way in which it lost the Copa final to Brazil three years ago in
Peru, Argentina was glad both teams set up a rematch in the final on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Argentina was moments from winning the 2004 final in injury time until Adriano
scored for 2-2 in the last act of regulation, forcing a penalty shootout in
which Brazil prevailed 4-2.
</P>
<P>
"It's a thorn I still have nailed to my back and I want to take it out,"
Argentina's Carlos Tevez said upon arriving in Venezuela three weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
That defeat, the first by Argentina to Brazil in nine Copa finals, made it
easier for coach Alfio Basile to convince some of his best players to keep their
boots on after the long European season. They haven't disappointed, justifying
their pre-tournament favoritism by sailing through the first South American
championship hosted by Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Inspired performances by Lionel Messi, Tevez and Juan Roman Riquelme have helped
the Albiceleste to a perfect 5-0 record, racking up a tournament-best 16
goals.
</P>
<P>
Argentina dispatched Peru 4-0 in the quarterfinals and Gold Cup runner-up Mexico
3-0 in the semifinals, hijacking the jogo bonito (beautiful play) expected of
its archrival.
</P>
<P>
However, since making the final, the Argentines have been determined to play
down hype that it was out to pay back Brazil.
</P>
<P>
"To focus in on the word revenge generates an obsession that can have a negative
impact on the team's psychological health," midfielder Esteban Cambiasso said.
"For us, the game is great opportunity to be crowned champions, against a rival
that we all want to play."
</P>
<P>
Unlike Argentina, Brazil was blown off by Ronaldinho and Kaka, who wanted a
holiday. Robinho, whose six goals make him the tournament's top scorer, has
filled in nicely but Brazil's younger team has still been inconsistent. It
opened with a 2-0 loss to Mexico, edged Ecuador 1-0 in its last group match,
crushed Chile 6-1 in the quarterfinals, and needed a penalty shootout to knock
out Uruguay in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people, they say 'Brazil doesn't play good, Brazil doesn't have the
same team.' Of course, we are a new team that hasn't played together, with new
players," Pele said this week. "But the most important thing is to represent
your country in the finals and Brazil is doing that. It's something you have to
respect."
</P>
<P>
The Argentines were the last people taking Brazil for granted, not only after
what happened in 2004, but also because of games since in their storied
rivalry.
</P>
<P>
Brazil won 4-1 to take the 2005 Confederations Cup, and 3-0 in London last
September in Dunga's first match as coach. Midfielder Elano scored twice that
day, and was expected to start on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"There's no favorite when Argentina and Brazil play," said defender Javier
Zanetti, one of six Argentine veterans of the 2004 loss who traveled to
Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, parity dominates the rivalry.
</P>
<P>
In 90 meetings since 1914 -- two years before the Copa America began -- Brazil has
won 35 times to Argentina's 33, although Argentina has 146 goals to Brazil's
142.
</P>
<P>
Brazil has five World Cups to Argentina's two, but in the Copa America Argentina
has ruled.
</P>
<P>
Argentina boasts a 15-8-8 overall record in the tournament against its much
larger neighbor.
</P>
<P>
The Argentines are tied with Uruguay for the most South American titles at 14,
while Brazil was a distant second with seven, though it's prevailed in three of
the last four editions of soccer's oldest international tournament.
</P>
<P>
Argentina's bid for its first Copa title since 1993 was likely to be without
striker Hernan Crespo, despite his hopes of returning for the final after
injuring his leg on a penalty kick during Argentina's 4-2 win over Colombia in
group play.
</P>
<P>
Brazil will miss midfielder Gilberto Silva, who was automatically suspended
after picking up his second yellow card against Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
"It's the big match, the one every player reaching the national team wants to
play," said Brazil winger Daniel Alves, who will play against Argentina for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
Uruguay meets Mexico for third place on Saturday in Caracas.
</P>
<P>
------
</P>
<P>
Possible lineups:
</P>
<P>
Argentina: Roberto Abbondanzieri, Javier Zanetti, Roberto Ayala, Gabriel Milito,
Gabriel Heinze, Juan Sebastian Veron, Javier Mascherano, Esteban Cambiasso, Juan
Roman Riquelme, Lionel Messi, Carlos Tevez/Hernan Crespo.
</P>
<P>
Brazil: Doni, Alex, Juan, Gilberto, Maicon, Elano, Mineiro, Josue, Julio

Valencia to host its second America ' s Cup in 2009

<P>
The America's Cup has another date with Valencia in 2009.
</P>
<P>
Swiss syndicate Alinghi will defend its Auld Mug trophy at the same site where
it won one of the most dramatic finals in the event's history, AC Management
president Michel Bonnefous said Wednesday at Port America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
Alinghi beat Emirates Team New Zealand 5-2 in the 32nd edition of sport's oldest
competition, which ended July 3.
</P>
<P>
The landlocked Swiss team picked Valencia to host the Cup this year after
beating the Kiwis 5-0 in 2003 to return the Cup to Europe for the first time
since the inaugural race in 1851. AC Management was the company set up by
Alinghi owner and biotech billionaire Ernesto Bertarelli to run the
event.
</P>
<P>
But the 33rd edition of the event might be sailing in Valencia even
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Golden Gate Yacht Club last week filed suit in New York State court, which has
jurisdiction to settle all disputes in the competition. It is seeking to replace
Desafio Espanol as the official challenger for the next regatta and void already
agreed rules changes to the size of the boats.
</P>
<P>
A judge could also force Alinghi to sail against BMW Oracle Racing in a
best-of-three match. That regatta would likely be held next July in
Valencia.
</P>
<P>
The "challenger of record" negotiates the race format and rules with the
defending winner on behalf of all challenging syndicates.
</P>
<P>
In the suit, Golden Gate claimed CNEV -- Desafio's yacht club -- was an "invalid
challenger" and that the Swiss yacht club was "engaging in self-dealing" by
accepting the Spanish challenge.

Human Rights Watch accuses Spain of failing to protect the rights of migrant children
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MADRID, Spain 2007-07-26 10:58:47 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hundreds of migrant African children are being mistreated and neglected by
Spanish authorities at holding centers on the Canary Islands, a U.S. human
rights group said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
More than 900 migrant children, aged 10 to 17, have been kept for the past year
in four emergency centers on the islands, located off the coast of northwest
Africa. Most of the children are from Senegal and Morocco.
</P>
<P>
The New York-based Human Rights Watch said in a special report that many of the
children's basic human rights were being ignored.
</P>
<P>
They were often kept in overcrowded and poor conditions, without access to
education, health care or sufficiently sanitary food, according to the report,
titled "Unwelcome Responsibilities."
</P>
<P>
Though technically migrant children are not allowed under Spanish law to be
detained, "they are kept in almost prison-like conditions," said Simone Troller,
Europe children's rights researcher for Human Rights Watch and author of the
report.
</P>
<P>
"They are not allowed to leave the centers on their own. They have to stay in
the compounds, and sometimes you have young children mixed with old children,"
Troller told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
The children were among some 30,000 immigrants who arrived illegally in the
Canary Islands last year aboard packed fishing boats from north and West Africa
in hopes of finding better economic opportunities in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"We found many children in those centers who had not been properly interviewed"
by Spanish authorities, Troller said. "They have stayed there for six months,
and they would say to me that I was the first person to talk to them for five
minutes."
</P>
<P>
She said several of the children had also complained of beatings.
</P>
<P>
Human Rights Watch interviewed 75 of the children at the camps over a three-week
period in January.
</P>
<P>
Troller said Spain needed to investigate the reports of abuses, and must provide
children with full information on their rights in a language they understand,
particularly regarding education and residency and work permits.
</P>
<P>
"These children are entitled to residency permits, and we found that the
granting of these rights were very randomly provided," Troller
said.
</P>
<P>
"Our main concern is that nobody feels responsible for these children. It's a
question of a political deadlock; nobody seems to care what is happening to
these children ... These children are at serious risk."
</P>
<P>
Clandestine immigration has mushroomed into a major political problem for Spain
in recent years, with the country taking in more than a quarter of all
immigrants entering the European Union.
</P>
<P>
For decades, immigrant boats have set out from Morocco, sailing north across the
Strait of Gibraltar to the Spanish mainland or westward to the Canary
Islands.
</P>
<P>
More recently the immigrant boats tend to sail from west Africa, often spending
up to two weeks at sea.
</P>
<P>
In the case of adults, Spanish law gives authorities 40 days to identify and
repatriate them, after which time they must be freed.
</P>
<P>
Troller said she had presented the report to the Social Affairs Ministry as well
as the state attorney's office, but had received no promises of a prompt
solution.
</P>
<P>
"The central government has to come up with a plan to close these centers and to
transfer children into care arrangements where there full rights are protected,
where they are safe and secure, basically," she said.
</P>
<P>
Government comment on the report was not immediately available
Thursday.

Cuba wins 4 golds in athletics to finish ahead of Brazil in medals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cuba won four golds in athletics at the Pan American Games on Saturday to secure
second place in medals ahead of host Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The United States comfortably leads with 96 golds, but the Cubans and Brazil had
been jousting for second for the past couple of days.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, which hasn't finished higher than third since 1963, has 50 medals, nine
fewer than Cuba with only five events left before Sunday's closing
ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
Yeimer Lopez helped the Cubans stay ahead with a victory against two Brazilians
in the men's 800 meters. He clocked 1 minute, 44.58 seconds, breaking the Pan Am
record.
</P>
<P>
"I did not expect to have this time even though I was prepared for that. If it
wasn't raining, I would have made a better time, but this result pleases me a
lot," Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
Dayron Robles won the men's 110 hurdles in 13.25 seconds and teammate Guillermo
Martinez won the javelin throw with 77.66 meters. Cuba also won the 1,600 men's
relay in 3:27.51.
</P>
<P>
Brazil also won four golds in track and field, with Sabine Heitling in the
women's 3,000 steeplechase in 9:51.13, men's pole vault with Fabio Silva
clearing 5.4 meters, triple jump with Jadel Gregorio jumping 17.27, and men's
400 relay in 38.81.
</P>
<P>
"It was a good jump but I still hope to improve," said Gregorio, ranked second
in the world. "I want to hit my personal best of 17.9."
</P>
<P>
The Cubans won a total of 12 athletics golds, while Brazil was second-best with
8. The men's marathon will be on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Many athletes struggled in the cool, rainy weather in Rio, with temperatures of
62 degrees (17 Celsius).
</P>
<P>
Ecuador's Xavier Moreno overcame Horacio Nava of Mexico late in the race to win
the 50-kilometer walk in 3 hours, 52 minutes, 7 seconds. Nava finished 28
seconds behind, ahead of countryman Omar Zepeda de Leon.
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't feeling good in the final part and unfortunately couldn't maintain my
advantage," Nava said.
</P>
<P>
Mexico won three golds in canoeing. Manuel Cortina won the K-1 500 meters men's
race, then captured another victory in the K-2 500 with teammate Jesus Valdez.
Jose Cristobal Quirino won the C-1 500.
</P>
<P>
The Mexicans also won the women's 3-meter synchronized springboard, with Laura
Sanchez and Paola Espinosa, who added her third gold in Rio. She also won a
silver.
</P>
<P>
Brazil won the men's volleyball final 25-16, 25-20, 25-22 against the United
States, winning its first title since the 1983 games in Caracas -- and third
overall.
</P>
<P>
In softball, organizers decided that the Americans (4-0, with three no-hitters)
would be awarded the gold and Venezuela (3-1) would get the silver after
Saturday's games were rained out. A steady rain meant the fields, which have
been troublesome all week, probably wouldn't be in shape to play on Sunday, the
final day of the Pan Ams.
</P>
<P>
Eight-time sailing world champion Robert Scheidt of Brazil lost the gold in the
laser class to Andrew Campbell of the United States. Other sailors collecting
gold were Ricardo Winicki of Brazil in RS-X and Dominique Vallee of Canada in
the women's RS-X.
