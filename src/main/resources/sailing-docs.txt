Chilean navy searching for American solo sailor adrift on disabled yacht
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SANTIAGO, Chile 2007-01-03 19:00:27 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chilean navy has launched a search-and-rescue operation for a Southern
California sailor adrift off the tip of South America while trying to
circumnavigate the globe, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ken Barnes, 47, of Newport Beach, California, set off from Long Beach on Oct. 28
in a 44-foot catch called the Privateer in hopes of sailing around the world.
His longtime girlfriend, Cathy Chambers, said he called her Tuesday on his
satellite phone to say he was in trouble.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Coast Guard and Chilean maritime officials also picked up signals from
Barnes' distress beacon Tuesday afternoon and believe he is about 500 miles (800
kilometers) off the Pacific coast of Chile.
</P>
<P>
Barnes told Chambers he had lost engine power and steering and had two broken
masts and broken hatches, she said. The Privateer was also taking on water in
40-knot winds and 25-foot (7.6-meter) swells, he reported.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning, a Chilean navy search aircraft flew over the area where
the Barnes' disabled yacht is believed to be, but clouds and rain kept the plane
from spotting the yacht, navy press officer Paula Paredes said by telephone from
Punta Arenas, 3,200 kilometers (1,990 miles) south of the capital of
Santiago.
</P>
<P>
Weather conditions in the area were expected to improve by Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Paredes said the navy also dispatched a tugboat to the western entry to the
straits of Magellan on the tip of South America, and ordered a trawler and a
merchant boat already there to join the search. None of the boats was expected
to reach Barnes before the weekend, however.
</P>
<P>
Paredes said Barnes "is alive and well and keeping satellite telephone contact
with relatives in California."
</P>
<P>
According to Barnes' Web site, he "continue(d) to ride out the storm with
disabled Privateer" on Wednesday and anticipated that the Chilean navy would
drop communication and support equipment to him.
</P>
<P>
Chambers said Barnes has called her several times since, for no more than a
minute each time. He last called around 5 a.m. PST (1300 GMT) Wednesday, she
said.
</P>
<P>
"We need someone out there right away to get to him. He has supplies but I don't
know how many of them are good and how many aren't because now there's water in
the boat," said Chambers, who was keeping vigil in the couple's Newport Beach
home with Barnes' family.
</P>
<P>
Barnes first reported his emergency to the U.S. Coast Guard, which contacted the
Chilean navy.
</P>
<P>
"I do know from reviewing his Web site that he was well-equipped for the journey
he was making. He had all the survival gear on board," said Coast Guard
spokesman Lt. Tim McGhee.
</P>
<P>
On his Web site, Barnes wrote that he planned his trip for several
years.
</P>
<P>
"For many years, probably from the age of 10, I have liked the solitude of
sailing, the adventure, the adrenaline associated with the chance encounter of
the unknown," he said.

Malaysia denies cracking down on Islamic newspaper over Michelle Yeoh photo
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia 2007-01-04 09:24:10 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Malaysian authorities have seized from newsstands copies of a tabloid newspaper
run by an opposition Islamic party, but denied the move was sparked by the
publication of a photograph that shows the prime minister at a public event with
actress Michelle Yeoh.
</P>
<P>
The latest issue of Harakah features a front page photograph of Prime Minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi placing a hand on Yeoh's bare shoulder during a dinner
ceremony at an international sailing tournament in Malaysia's northeastern
Terengganu state last month.
</P>
<P>
Officers from the Internal Security Ministry have confiscated copies from retail
outlets over the past week because the newspaper is supposed to be sold only to
members of the opposition Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party, the ministry's
enforcement spokesman, Zailani Hashim, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The action has nothing to do with images published in the issue," Zailani said,
rejecting speculation by Harakah's editor that the government wants to prevent
the photo from being seen.
</P>
<P>
Harakah's Web site said the photograph displayed Abdullah's "naughty antics"
with Yeoh, a Malaysian-born star whose international film credits include
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and the James Bond film, "Tomorrow Never
Dies."
</P>
<P>
The Islamic party that publishes Harakah has often accused Abdullah's moderate
government of failing to uphold religious and moral standards in this Southeast
Asian country, where nearly two-thirds of the 26 million people are ethnic Malay
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
The party is the main political rival of Abdullah's ruling coalition and
publishes 140,000 copies of Harakah twice a month. The newspaper's
government-approved publication license states it can only be sold to party
members, but the rule is often not stringently enforced.
</P>
<P>
Fewer than 100 copies have been seized from outlets in Malaysia's main city,
Kuala Lumpur, Zailani said. He added that the government has the right to
retract the newspaper's permit because it was violating its conditions, but no
such action is being planned so far.
</P>
<P>
Harakah's editor, Ahmad Lutfi Othman, said the permit's conditions were unfair.
He noted that copies had sometimes been confiscated from public outlets between
1999 and 2000, but that this was the first such incident since he became editor
last February.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the government is now trying to create a culture of fear through
these raids," Ahmad Lutfi said. "We're studying this matter with plans to
challenge the regulations in court."
</P>
<P>
International and local rights groups have long criticized restrictions on press
freedoms in Malaysia, where the government is closely linked with the mainstream
media and wields tough laws that require publishers to obtain annual permits
from authorities.

SAILING: British teen lands in Antigua after record-breaking solo sail across
Atlantic
</P>
<P>
ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) -- A British teenager became the youngest person to sail
solo across the Atlantic Ocean on Wednesday, reaching the Caribbean island of
Antigua after a six-week voyage.
</P>
<P>
Mike Perham, 14, raised his fist triumphantly to a crowd of Antiguan officials
and supporters as he docked outside St. John's on the southeastern side of the
island.
</P>
<P>
Perham said he was lonely at times but not afraid as he made the crossing in the
Cheeky Monkey, his 28-foot (8.5-meter) sailboat. He helped pass the time by
studying and chatting on a satellite phone.
</P>
<P>
"It has been a fantastic journey," he said.
</P>
<P>
Perham, who was trailed by his father in another boat, set sail Nov. 18 from
Gibraltar and made brief stops to replace satellite phones in the Canary Islands
and Cape Verde. They were originally expected to complete the 3,500-mile
(5600-kilometer) trip just before Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
Perham's father, Peter, praised his son's courage and tenacity.
</P>
<P>
"At home in England you can't even climb a tree without a safety certificate, so
I hope it will ignite a little spark in some families," he told reporters. "When
a child puts their mind to really want to do something they should be thoroughly
supported."

Origin marks return of Britain to America ' s Cup
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON 2007-01-04 13:40:57 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Britain will race in the America's Cup again after the launch of Origin on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Keith Mills, former chief executive of the London 2012 bid committee, will
spearhead Britain's effort to bring the Auld Mug to Britain for the first time
in the competition's 155-year history.
</P>
<P>
"This is the only major sporting trophy in this country that we have never won,"
Mills said. "My aim is to build a team capable of finally winning this elusive
trophy, and in doing so, win the right to host the America's Cup back on British
shores for the first time in over 150 years."
</P>
<P>
Britain hosted the first race off the English coast in 1851, when the New
York-owned schooner America beat the host's Aurora.
</P>
<P>
Origin will enter the 33rd and 34th America's Cup races. The 32nd America's Cup
will be held in Valencia, Spain, from June 23-July 7.
</P>
<P>
"We need to be ready to go as soon as this cup ends," Mills said. "Because the
next cup cycle is likely to be quick, we need the time between now and July to
nail down key people."
</P>
<P>
Mills said there had been "significant" discussions with designers and sponsors
in the past 10-12 months. Yachtsmen will be signed up immediately after the
America's Cup final in July, with talks already under way with crewman who are
under contract with other teams.
</P>
<P>
A first boat will be launched in 2008, with the launch of the second scheduled
for 2009. Origin will have an annual budget of euro30 million ($39 million),
with Mills looking to attract up to three major sponsors and finalize an
agreement with a yacht club by June.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to finish in the top three or four teams in the first challenge
realistically, and then be in a position to win the cup in the 34th challenge,"
Mills said.
</P>
<P>
Royal Yachting Association chief executive Rod Carr said it's the right time to
launch an entry since British sailing has "never been as successful as it is
today."
</P>
<P>
"In my view, there are three peaks in competitive racing," Carr said. "Britain
has already scaled the heights in the Olympic and offshore arena, and I believe
we have the talent and expertise to create a winning America's Cup
team."
</P>
<P>
Britain has won 10 sailing medals -- including five golds -- in the past two
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The last British entry -- GBR Challenge -- lost in the Louis Vuitton Cup
challenger series quarterfinals at the 31st America's Cup. Sovereign was the
last British yacht to reach the America's Cup final in 1964, losing 4-0 to
American boat Constellation.
</P>
<P>
Swiss boat Alinghi, the defending champion, is the only European team to have
won the oldest trophy in sport.
</P>
<P>
Mills is a non-executive director of Tottenham football club and remains
involved with London 2012 Games as a non-executive deputy chairman.

<TEXT>
<P>
A Portuguese man was missing and presumed dead after falling from a yacht that
he and a friend were sailing from Antigua to Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
Luiz Santos, 36, went overboard while fixing a sail on the 42-foot (13-meter)
Wendy during a storm on Dec. 29, skipper Alvaro Conbe said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A two-day search involving two U.S. Coast Guard aircraft and three merchant
ships was called off after finding no sign of Santos, according to the Bermuda
Maritime Operations Center.
</P>
<P>
Conbe, a 29-year-old Spaniard, said he threw a flotation device to Santos but
after turning the boat around, he could not find the man in the rough water
about 350 miles (560 kilometers) southeast of Bermuda. Conbe arrived in Bermuda

Navy aircraft spots American sailor adrift off Chilean coast, trawler sailing for rescue
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SANTIAGO, Chile 2007-01-04 17:42:18 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Chilean navy search plane has located an American solo sailor on his disabled
yacht off the southern tip of South America, the navy reported, but the U.S.
Embassy said he probably could not be rescued until Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The navy said in a brief written statement that a trawler was sailing to rescue
the Southern California sailor, Ken Barnes, who on Wednesday lost contact with
friends when the battery of his satellite telephone ran down.
</P>
<P>
Barnes, 47, had planned to sail around the world when he set off from Long Beach
on Oct. 28 in his 44-foot ketch.
</P>
<P>
He was wearing a survival suit and didn't appear to be in immediate danger,
according to his girlfriend, Cathy Chambers, who had been in contact with him by
telephone.
</P>
<P>
The navy did not say when the trawler Polar Pesca 1 was expected to reach
Barnes' yacht Privateer, but it was about 500 kilometers (295 miles) away when
the navy plane spotted the yacht on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy, Judith Baroody, said it probably would not
reach Barnes before Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Baroody said the embassy had been in contact both with Barnes' family and with
Chilean authorities and has "full confidence" in the capacity of Chilean
authorities to handle the emergency.
</P>
<P>
One of the pilots of the aircraft, Capt. Gonzalo Vasquez, told the Chilean state
television that Privateer was not in danger of sinking.
</P>
<P>
The other pilot, Capt. Cesar Delgado, added that "we will continue to fly,
keeping watch on the yacht, so we can support the boats now sailing toward it
with information."
</P>
<P>
The navy said that the 12-meter (40-foot) waves and strong winds that disabled
the Privateer had abated and weather conditions had improved greatly so that
officials expect "excellent conditions to allow the ships in the area of the
emergency to reach (Barnes) as soon as possible to rescue him."
</P>
<P>
In addition to the trawler, the navy tugboat Leucoton, which has a helicopter,
and a merchant boat from Malta that were operating in the area were also ordered
to join the rescue effort near the western entry to the Straits of
Magellan.
</P>
<P>
Chambers said in Newport Beach, California, that she received a satellite phone
from the sailor at 5:26 p.m. PST (0126 GMT) Wednesday in which he said that
would probably be his last because the telephone phone had run out of
battery.
</P>
<P>
Until then, Barnes had kept frequent telephone contact with her. He had also
contacted officials and used the phone on Tuesday to first report that the storm
had disabled his boat.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Coast Guard and Chilean maritime officials picked up signals from his
distress beacon Tuesday afternoon, when he was believed to be about 500 miles
off the Pacific coast.
</P>
<P>
After getting the call Wednesday evening, Chambers said Barnes "is shaky,
scared, but I think he's hopeful now that he's seen the plane and he knows
they've located him."
</P>
<P>
Chambers said Barnes "has supplies but I don't know how many of them are good
and how many aren't because now there's water in the boat."

North Korea ship detained for safety violations leaves Hong Kong port
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HONG KONG 2007-01-05 05:18:06 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A North Korean cargo ship was sailing home Friday after being stranded in Hong
Kong for two months waiting for its cash-strapped country to send money to fix
equipment that violated safety regulations.
</P>
<P>
The Kang Nam 5 left its moorings on Thursday night after its owners finally paid
for the repairs to its lifesaving, communications and emergency lighting
equipment, said the ship's local agent, Topping Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The vessel's inspection papers and navigational charts were also deemed
insufficient after the ship arrived without cargo on Oct. 25 from the southern
Taiwanese port of Kaohsiung. Topping said the vessel usually hauls scrap
metal.
</P>
<P>
There was much speculation that Hong Kong's move was in response to new U.N.
sanctions ordering the inspection of North Korean ships -- measures imposed after
North Korea's Oct. 9 nuclear test.
</P>
<P>
But Hong Kong officials insisted that the inspection was routine and unrelated
to the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
A Topping spokesman, who only gave his surname, Wong, said the ship was sailing
to North Korea's western port of Nampo. It planned to stop to refuel in the port
of Lianyungang in the eastern Chinese province of Jiangsu, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"It may take up to three or four days to sail to Jiangsu because of bad weather.
The vessel is expected to arrive home in about one week," Wong
said.
</P>
<P>
Wong said ships are often detained in Hong Kong for safety checks, but a cargo
vessel has never been held for such a long time.
</P>
<P>
"It may be due to their funding problems. And North Korean ships are less likely
to comply with safety measures than the others," he said.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported the ship's repair bill was about US$30,000 (euro22,890),
with an additional US$5,000 (euro3,815) for anchorage fees.
</P>
<P>
The ship will return without its scrap metal cargo because the Hong Kong company
that was supposed to consign the shipment had canceled due to the delay, Wong
said.
</P>
<P>
The Kang Nam 5 was the second vessel to be detained for safety violations in
Hong Kong since the U.N. sanctions were imposed. The first ship, Kang Nam I, was
held on Oct. 22, but was released 13 days later after complying with safety
regulations.

American sailor rescued after 3 days adrift at sea
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PUNTA ARENAS, Chile 2007-01-05 14:00:12 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An American sailor was rescued early Friday after three days adrift on a
disabled yacht in treacherous seas off the southern tip of South America, the
Chilean navy said.
</P>
<P>
Ken Barnes, 47, was picked up shortly before 8 a.m. (1100GMT) by the Chilean
trawler Polar Pesca 1, the navy's Operations Department reported in Punta
Arenas, on Chile's southwestern tip.
</P>
<P>
An officer, who asked not to be identified in line with the department's rules,
said by telephone that Barnes was in good condition except for a small wound in
his right thigh.
</P>
<P>
Relatives hugged and cried in joy as word of his rescue reached the Newport
Beach, California, condominium where they had gathered.
</P>
<P>
Barnes' 21-year-old twin daughters, his longtime girlfriend and his mother
huddled around the cell phone, trying to make out his words over a broken
connection that lasted less than 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"I love you. I'm on the fishing boat headed for Punta Arenas and I'm OK and
everything's OK," he said in a calm voice. "I should be there in a day or
two."
</P>
<P>
Barnes' mother, June Dee Linn, broke into tears upon hearing he had been
rescued. "I'm just picturing him on the ship and being grateful that he's been
picked up," she said.
</P>
<P>
The trawler was guided to the disabled yacht by a navy plane. Pilots first
spotted a flare, then saw the American sailor, who was wearing a yellow jacket
and waving.
</P>
<P>
The trawler sent four men on an inflatable boat to pick up the
sailor.
</P>
<P>
"Once onboard the trawler, he contacted us by radio," said pilot Capt. Cesar
Delgado. "He said he was well, except for a minor cut on his right thigh. And he
repeatedly thanked the Chilean navy for its help."
</P>
<P>
Barnes' attempt to sail nonstop around the world was interrupted when his
44-foot ketch hit a storm that broke both its masts and soaked the sailor's
supplies and food. The ketch also lost its engine power.
</P>
<P>
Barnes set off from Long Beach, California, on Oct. 28.
</P>
<P>
The navy officer said he would be taken to Punta Arenas, a trip that could take
up to two days.
</P>
<P>
Delgado said the duration of the trip will depend mainly on the wind, "which
changes here virtually every 12 hours and sometimes is very, very strong, making
sailing very slow."
</P>
<P>
Barnes's ketch Privateer had been spotted early Wednesday by one of two planes
sent by the navy from central Chile. The planes continued flying over the area
to help guide the trawler, had been about 295 miles (475 kilometers)
away.
</P>
<P>
The Privateer had been disabled by strong winds and 40-foot (12-meter) waves as
it sailed near the tip of South America. Weather conditions have since improved
in the area, according to the navy.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Coast Guard and Chilean maritime officials picked up signals from
Barnes' distress beacon Tuesday afternoon, when he was believed to be about 500
miles (800 kilometers) off the Pacific coast, at the western entry to the
Straits of Magellan.
</P>
<P>
Pictures of the disabled vessel, taken by a search plane, were posted on the
family's Web site.
</P>
<P>
Barnes had planned his trip for several years, his Web site said.
</P>
<P>
"For many years, probably from the age of 10, I have liked the solitude of
sailing, the adventure, the adrenaline associated with the chance encounter of
the unknown," he said.
</P>
<P>
His girlfriend, Cathy Chambers, said she had supported Barnes' dream to sail
around the world, but had now changed her mind.
</P>
<P>
"He attempted it, he tried it, but after what I know now -- no way! His life is
too important," she said.

Pan Am officials disapprove changes at sailing venue
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil 2007-02-03 14:37:25 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pan American Games officials have not accepted the proposed construction changes
at the competition's sailing venue, putting the boating event in jeopardy five
months before the Games.
</P>
<P>
A judicial dispute between a government entity and the Rio de Janeiro Pan
American Games Organizing Committee has stalled construction at the venue, and
the proposal to build temporary installations was disapproved by officials from
the Pan American Sports Organization, or PASO.
</P>
<P>
"It does not accept the organizing committee's proposal to modify the original
project," members of the organization said in a statement released Friday after
a three-day visit to Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
The organization said the modifications would be prejudicial to the event, and
because of the "seriousness of the situation," it decided to relay the findings
for an analysis by PASO president Mario Vazquez Rana.
</P>
<P>
"If the president doesn't authorize the venue to be used, there's a risk the
sailing competition will not take place," Julio Cesar Maglione, president of
PASO's coordinating committee, told the local sports daily Lance. "And
unfortunately, without Olympic standards for sailing, Rio's bid for 2016 becomes
impossible."
</P>
<P>
Rio de Janeiro is a pre-candidate to host the 2016 Olympics, and the July 13-29
Pan American Games are seen as a test for the city.
</P>
<P>
Construction at the sailing venue stopped in December because of court orders
won by a government entity in charge of national patrimony. It claimed permanent
changes at the national park chosen for the event were not allowed.
</P>
<P>
There was no timetable for a final judicial decision.
</P>
<P>
The officials visiting Rio de Janeiro praised the overall preparation for the
Games, and said the only other topic that needed to be addressed was the
infrastructure around the Pan American Village, especially because of poor road
access to the buildings.
</P>
<P>
"We are very pleased seeing how the construction sites are developing," Maglione
said. "They are at an extraordinary level."

Members of the Pan American Sports Organization, or PASO, last week disapproved
the proposal to build provisional installations. On Thursday, PASO president
Mario Vazquez Rana said the organization reconsidered its decision and would
make an exception.
</P>
<P>
"PASO decided to exceptionally approve the (alternate) project," Rana said in a
statement. "This decision is fundamental to guarantee the sailing competition in
the Games and protect the interests and expectations of the sport's
athletes."
</P>
<P>
Construction at the sailing venue stopped in December because of court orders
won by a government body in charge of national patrimony. It claimed permanent
changes at the national park chosen for the event were not allowed.
</P>
<P>
The Games' organizing committee said the construction of temporary installations
was the only alternative to guarantee the sailing competition.
</P>
<P>
Rana said the original project must be restarted if a final judicial decision in
favor of the organizing committee is reached. There was no timetable for the
decision.
</P>
<P>
"The original project would leave a legacy for Brazil's Olympic sports and would
be a matter of pride for the Pan American Games," Rana said.
</P>
<P>
Rio de Janeiro is a pre-candidate to host the 2016 Olympics, and the Pan
American Games are seen as a test for the city.

Coutts and Cayard launch sailing series
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WELLINGTON, New Zealand 2007-02-09 11:49:57 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American sailor Paul Cayard joined New Zealander Russell Coutts and Portuguese
promoter Joao Lagos on Friday to launch the World Sailing League, an annual
global racing series with a US$2 million winner's check.
</P>
<P>
The series, in which 12 national teams will race 22-meter (70-foot) catamarans
on a circuit running up to eight months -- drawing elements from Olympic sailing
and Formula One motor racing -- will debut in 2009, Cayard was scheduled to tell
a news conference in Lisbon, Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Cayard said he and Coutts -- both former Olympians, world champions and America's
Cup-winning helmsmen -- had developed the concept into a competitive
reality.
</P>
<P>
"This project has been three years in the planning," said Cayard. "We've worked
together on the concept over that period with different phases of
intensity."
</P>
<P>
The series will follow F1's example of having a set, global calendar with racing
taking place at a wide range of venues in North and South America, northern
Europe, the Mediterranean, the Middle East and Asia.
</P>
<P>
It will have the nationalism which is the keynote of the Olympics, Cayard
said.
</P>
<P>
Racing would be held close to shore, to enhance spectator involvement, and while
fleet races among 12 teams are envisaged, time trials and slalom racing might
also be featured.
</P>
<P>
Cayard said he and Coutts would have input into the designs of the catamarans
along with a team including leading designers Marc Van Peteghem and Lauriot
Prévost. Coutts and Cayard would oversee design work, the launch of a prototype
around the end of 2007 and the construction of a fleet of one-design yachts for
use in the inaugural series.
</P>
<P>
After establishing a class rule and putting in place additional technical and
official framework for the series, the pair would then concentrate on their
roles as competitors, lending headline names to the series in its formative
seasons.
</P>
<P>
Cayard said he, Coutts and Lagos had already had numerous expressions of
interest from potential competitors, drawn from a wide range of sailing
disciplines. The World Sailing League offered a career path and professional
opportunity to sailors from Olympic class, keeler, monohull and multihull
backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
"Russell, João Lagos and I are pooling our experiences from the America's Cup,
the Olympic Games and a multitude of other sporting competitions," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We have taken the best ideas from sports events all over the world and added
innovative concepts to generate an exciting new series that will maximise the
appeal to sailors, sponsors and spectators.
</P>
<P>
"For a venture like this, it was also important that the(International Sailing
Federation) support the concept and they have confirmed they are fully behind
us."

Police briefly detain 2 men suspected of planning to hijack Istanbul ferry
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ANKARA, Turkey 2007-02-10 13:09:15 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police detained two men Saturday on suspicions that they were planning to hold
up an Istanbul ferry to protest the fact that pro-Armenian slogans had been
chanted at a slain journalist's funeral, police said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
An Istanbul court ordered the two men released after questioning, saying there
was not enough evidence to charge them.
</P>
<P>
Acting on a tip, police detained the two men at the city's entrance Saturday, a
police official said. He spoke on condition of anonymity because of rules that
bar civil servants from speaking to reporters without prior authorization.
</P>
<P>
Police said the two men -- from the eastern city of Igdir, near the borders with
Iran and Armenia -- allegedly planned to hijack a ferry sailing between the Asian
and European shores of the Bosporous, copying a ferry hijacking last month in
the Dardanelles strait, police said.
</P>
<P>
That hijacker had threatened to blow the ferry up in protesting the pro-American
slogans. He had been carrying a gun, but no explosives, and after about 2 1/2
hours surrendered to police. No passengers were harmed.
</P>
<P>
As the two men detained Saturday left the courthouse, they shouted: "Turks have
no other friends but Turks!" the state-run Anatolia news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Armenian journalist Hrant Dink, who spoke out about the mass killings of
Armenians in the early 20th century, was gunned down outside his newspaper in
Istanbul on Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
Dink had been brought to trial numerous times for allegedly "insulting
Turkishness," a crime under an article in the country's penal
code.
</P>
<P>
His funeral inspired a massive outpouring of support for reconciliation between
Armenians and Turks, with thousands chanting "We're all Armenians." Nationalists
however, were angered by the pro-Armenian slogans.

Hawaiian canoes make first landfall after long journey
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MAJURO, Marshall Islands 2007-02-19 21:18:26 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After traveling 2,200 miles across the Pacific and weathering several storms,
two voyaging canoes from Hawaii have arrived at their first destination.
</P>
<P>
The Hokulea and Alingano Maisu canoes made landfall in the lagoon of Majuro
Atoll on Sunday night. Crew members first sighted the tops of coconut trees
earlier in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The initial leg of the journey took 26 days.
</P>
<P>
"They're all smiles," said Maisu spokeswoman Pomai Bertelmann, who was aboard a
tour boat that met the canoes.
</P>
<P>
The crews were healthy but tired after paddling for nearly a month, she
said.
</P>
<P>
The international trip is being made to honor renowned navigator Mau Piailug of
Satawal, who taught Pacific way-finding to Native Hawaiians. The Maisu will be
presented to Piailug as a gift.
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, Piailug taught modern Hawaiians the ancient Polynesian art of
noninstrument navigation, which had been lost for centuries in the
islands.
</P>
<P>
"I'm so thrilled inside. I feel like crying," said Kawika Eskaran, one of the
builders of the Maisu. "I'm just glad they are safe."
</P>
<P>
The canoe crews plan to restock their vessels and rest before sailing to Majuro
for their first welcoming ceremony, which will include Marshall Islands
President Kesai Note.
</P>
<P>
Afterward, the vessels will sail west to Ponape, Chuuk, Pulawat and Satawal.
From there they head to Woleai, Ulithi and Yap, then to the Republic of Palau in
mid-March to complete the Micronesian trip.
</P>
<P>
The next part of their travels leads to Japan from March through May -- to honor
King David Kalakaua for his role in opening doors to Japanese migration in
1885.
</P>
<P>
The Hokulea will sail from Palau to Okinawa, Kumamoto, Nagasaki, Fukuoka,
Yamaguchi, Hiroshima, Uwajima and Yokohama.

U.S. tourist who killed mugger with bare hands sailing home
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SAN JOSE, Costa Rica 2007-02-24 04:03:35 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A U.S. tourist and the driver of the bus assaulted in Costa Rica recalled on
Friday moments of terror during an attempted robbery that ended when a military
veteran in her tour group killed the young assailant with his bare
hands.
</P>
<P>
Clova Adams, 54, realized the robbery was not a joke when a masked robber put a
gun to her head.
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was a skit. But then he pointed the gun at my head and grabbed me
by the throat and I thought I was going to die," said Adams, speaking by
telephone from the Carnival Liberty cruise ship, referring to the thwarted
robbery Wednesday during a ship stopover in Limon, 130 kilometers (80 miles)
east of San Jose, Costa Rica's capital.
</P>
<P>
Roberto Frances Allen, the Costa Rican driver who was at the wheel of the bus
that was assaulted, recalled gunshots and confusion during the
attack.
</P>
<P>
"I was very scared at the moment. I was driving to try to find help, as the
struggle was going on in the back," Allen said in an interview in
Limon.
</P>
<P>
"The bus was shaking, and women were screaming," he recalled. "There were two
shots and I heard him (Segura) try to fire more, but the gun didn't fire.
Luckily, the tourists had forced his hand up and the shots hit the roof of the
bus."
</P>
<P>
But the mother of the dead assailant, Warner Segura, 20, claimed the group of
tourists of "took the law into their own hands."
</P>
<P>
"I know my boy wasn't staying out of trouble, I knew that any moment I would get
bad news," said Segura's mother, Ligia Herrera Mendez, during an interview in
Limon. Segura had previous charges against him for assault, police
say.
</P>
<P>
"We want justice, this can't go unpunished, because they could have saved him
and nobody helped him," she said. Her son's body was buried Friday in the town
of Liverpool, about 10 miles (15 kilometers) outside Limon.
</P>
<P>
Limon police chief Luis Hernandez said earlier that the tourists drove Segura to
the local Red Cross branch after the confrontation, but he was already
dead.
</P>
<P>
But Herrera Mendez claimed the tourists "left him in the street."
</P>
<P>
Adams was part of a group of 12 American tourists who hired a local driver to
explore Costa Rica for a few hours. They were climbing out of the small bus to a
visit a Caribbean beach when three masked men ran toward them.
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, one of the tourists, a U.S. military veteran estimated to be in his
70s, grabbed the gunman in a headlock.
</P>
<P>
Hernandez said the man -- whom he refused to identify -- struggled with Segura,
breaking his clavicle and eventually killing him. The other two robbers
fled.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican officials interviewed the group, but said they would not charge the
U.S. tourist with any crime because he acted in self defense. "They were in
their right to defend themselves after being held up," Hernandez
said.
</P>
<P>
Herrera Mendez countered that "if this had happened in the United States, the
suspect would have been detained and would not have left the
country.
</P>
<P>
"Why, if they had already taken his gun away, didn't they turn him over to
police, so that he could have had the opportunity to reform himself?"
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica has struggled with violence and crime in recent years. University of
Kansas student Shannon Martin, 23, was stabbed to death in 2001 after she left a
nightclub in Golfito, 105 miles (170 kilometers) south of San
Jose.
</P>
<P>
Carnival Cruise Lines confirmed in a statement that one of the ship's guests had
killed the Costa Rican assailant, but refused to name those involved.
</P>
<P>
"All of the guests involved, who had booked the cruise together as a group, have
opted to continue with their vacation plans. Carnival is providing full support
and assistance to the guests," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The ship was sailing back to the U.S. on Friday, due to arrive Sunday in Fort
Lauderdale, Florida.

Slow down and watch out for whales, Spain tells ships in Strait of Gibraltar
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MADRID, Spain 2007-02-24 15:15:22 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Spain wants ships passing through the Strait of Gibraltar -- one of the world's
busiest maritime routes -- to slow down and watch out for whales.
</P>
<P>
The navy issued the recommendation this month, urging ships to go no faster than
13 knots and sail "in a maximum state of vigilance" so as not to collide with
the mammals. Sailing speeds in the strait separating Europe from Africa vary
greatly but can reach 30 knots in the case of high-speed ferries. A knot is 1.15
mph (1.85 kph).
</P>
<P>
Collisions between ships and whales are hard to document, but Spanish
environmentalists have been pressing for years for a measure like the one Spain
has just announced.
</P>
<P>
Renaud de Stephanis, a marine biologist with the Center for Conservation,
Information and Research on Cetaceans, an environmental group based on Spain's
southern coast, on Saturday called the step historic -- "the first time in the
Mediterranean, and probably in Europe, a measure of this kind has been
taken."
</P>
<P>
Fast ferries are the big danger for endangered sperm whales -- huge, lumbering
creatures that surface to breath and come into the strait from the Mediterranean
from February to July to feed.
</P>
<P>
"They do not know what is going on around them," said Katharina Heyer, president
of the Foundation for Information and Research on Marine Mammals, another
environmental group, based in the Spanish town of Tarifa overlooking the
strait.
</P>
<P>
She said figures on ship-whale collisions in the waterway linking the Atlantic
and the Mediterranean are scarce, but "it does happen."
</P>
<P>
During the feeding season, the strait is home to 20-30 sperm whales, which
measure up to 18 meters long (60 feet) and year-round there is a population of
about 300 smaller pilot whales, said de Stephanis.
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem is that currents in the strait are so strong that when a
whale does get hit the water quickly washes it into the open Mediterranean,
making it hard to keep track of collisions, de Stephanis said.
</P>
<P>
A CIRCE report prepared for the Spanish environment ministry said that from
2001-2005 there were two confirmed collisions with sperm whales in the Strait
and three other reported ones involving species called fin whales.
</P>
<P>
De Stephanis said that while on a research mission in September 2002 he happened
to witness one of those crashes between a sperm whale and a ferry, this one
heading from Morocco to Spain. The vessel did not stop after hitting the
whale.
</P>
<P>
"Its ribs were broken and it had a very big internal hemorrhage," De Stephanis
said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
The whale bled for about an hour and died, and was then towed into the
Mediterranean by a maritime rescue vessel to get the carcass out of the shipping
lanes.

Iran has pardoned and released a French tourist convicted of taking photos of
ships in the Persian Gulf, the French Foreign Ministry said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Stephane Lherbier, arrested along with a German national in November 2005, was

Douste-Blazy welcomed the release and expressed hope that the German, Donald
Klein, would also be released in the coming days.
</P>

The two were arrested for straying into Iran's territorial waters during a
sailing trip off the coast of neighboring United Arab Emirates. Iran's Foreign
Ministry confirmed in January 2006 that they were tried and convicted, but gave

8 Haitians die, 44 missing after boat catches on fire off Dominican Republic
</HEADLINE>

SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic 2007-03-01 23:55:01 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A boat carrying Haitian migrants caught fire off the coast of the Dominican
Republic, leaving at least eight passengers dead and 44 missing, a U.S. Coast
Guard spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The boat was traveling from the northern Haitian town of Cap-Haitien to the
Turks and Caicos when it caught fire about 23 miles (37 kilometers) north of the
Dominican Republic, U.S. Coast Guard spokesman Petty Officer Barry Bena
said.
</P>
<P>
Two migrants were pulled from the water Wednesday and brought to a hospital in
Montecristi on the Dominican Republic's north coast.
</P>
<P>
It appeared the migrants had been in the water for at least a day when they were
spotted by a U.S. sailboat cruising from Panama, said Capt. Jose Antonio
Carrero, commander of the Dominican Navy's northern operations.
</P>
<P>
"They found just the two people, not the boat, not anything," Carrero
said.
</P>
<P>
Those rescued, a man and a woman, were being treated Thursday for first-degree
burns and dehydration, Dr. Maria Belliard said.
</P>
<P>
Eight of the passengers were found dead in the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Coast Guard cutter, two airplanes and a helicopter were searching for
other survivors, Bena said. A Dominican Navy ship assisted in rescue efforts
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Authorities did not know when the blaze occurred, when the migrants set sail or
what caused the fire.
</P>
<P>
Fleeing grinding poverty and frequent political turmoil, thousands of Haitians
take to the sea each year, sailing on flimsy boats north toward Florida. Nearly
all of them are intercepted and repatriated to their homeland, where the vast
majority of its 8 million population lives on less than US$1 (euro.76) a
day.
</P>
<P>
The number of boat migrants increased after a 2004 revolt toppled then president
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, sending the economy into tailspin and touching off a
bloody wave of street violence.

Coast Guard searches for 49 Haitian migrants off Dominican Republic ' s coast

<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Coast Guard crews searched waters off the north coast of the Dominican
Republic Friday for 49 Haitian migrants missing since their homemade boat caught
fire, an agency spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
At least five people died when the fiberglass vessel the migrants were
apparently taking from the northern Haitian town of Cap-Haitien to the Turks and
Caicos Islands caught fire about 23 miles (37 kilometers) north of the Dominican
Republic. Authorities did not know when the blaze occurred, when the migrants
set sail or what caused the fire.
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard mistakenly reported having found eight passengers dead on
Thursday because a pilot counted some bodies twice, according to U.S. Coast
Guard spokesman Petty Officer Barry Bena. Five bodies were found by a
Liberian-flagged merchant marine ship on Thursday, Bena said.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Coast Guard cutter, airplane and helicopter have not located any other
bodies or survivors in the 1,250 square mile (3,237 sq. kilometer)
area.
</P>
<P>
Two of what is estimated to have been 54 passengers on the boat were plucked
from the Atlantic on Tuesday afternoon by an American couple sailing from Panama
to Antigua.
</P>
<P>
"I spotted an odd shape in the water. I thought it was a buoy," Jan Hein, a
53-year-old elementary school teacher from Gig Harbor, Washington, told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
But as she and husband Bruce Smith piloted their 34-foot wooden sailboat closer,
curiosity turned to horror when they realized the shape was a man and a woman
clinging to a stringy, charred piece of fiberglass.
</P>
<P>
"They were suffering," Hein said by phone from aboard their boat, the Woodwind,
which was ported Friday in the northcoast Dominican town of Montecristi.
</P>
<P>
Hein and Smith lifted 27-year-old Djenson Loucien and a 23-year-old woman named
Julie into their boat, washed the salt out of their burn wounds and tried to
keep them warm after issuing a distress call.
</P>
<P>
The migrants told the Heins they had possibly spent days clinging to the
wreckage after a gas tank exploded while refueling at night.
</P>
<P>
The American couple sailed five hours south to the Dominican coast when no help
came to meet them. Another sailboat owner answered their call upon arriving in
Montecristi and helped rush the two Haitians to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
The pair were in stable condition Friday, and could spend at least two more
weeks in the hospital, said Dr. Braulio Manuel Reynoso. Hein said their care was
being paid for by the other sailboat owner, a developer with projects in the
Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with
Haiti.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Haitians take to the sea on flimsy boats each year, heading north
toward Florida to escape grinding poverty and frequent political turmoil in the
Western Hemisphere's poorest country. Nearly all are intercepted and repatriated
to their homeland, where the vast majority of the nation's 8 million people
lives on less than US$1 (euro0.76) a day.

As yachts go mega, so do marinas
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico 2007-03-04 01:13:41 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the yachts get bigger and more numerous, the Caribbean is running out of
parking space.
</P>
<P>
The answer to this invasion of the so-called megayachts? Megamarinas.
</P>
<P>
From the Bahamas in the north to St. Lucia in the south, island governments and
entrepreneurs in the Caribbean and western Atlantic are developing waterfront
property and expanding marinas to handle yachts that range from 80 feet (24
meters) to longer than a football field.
</P>
<P>
The goal is to lure the ultra-rich yachting set and the millions of dollars it
can pour into the local economies.
</P>
<P>
Leading the pack is Yacht Haven Grande in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, which
is being upgraded at a cost of US$200 million (euro151.94 million) in a part of
Charlotte Amalie harbor once so blighted that boaters called it "rat
haven."
</P>
<P>
Promoted as the largest megayacht facility in the Caribbean, the marina has
hosted Rising Sun, a 452-foot (138-meter), five-story behemoth with 82 rooms and
a generator capable of powering a small town. The megayacht, the world's fifth
largest, was built for Oracle Corp. co-founder and CEO Larry
Ellison.
</P>
<P>
Yacht Haven Grande features in-slip systems that can pump 150 gallons (568
liters) of fuel a minute, supply ample electricity, remove sewage and oil and
provide gourmet food and drink served by marina employees in crisp
uniforms.
</P>
<P>
In Grenada, workers recently broke ground on a privately funded US$562 million
(euro426.95 million) resort and marina with spaces for 280 boats, a dozen of
them for yachts longer than 250 feet (76 meters), plus two hotels and hundreds
of condos and apartments.
</P>
<P>
In Puerto Rico, the Ports Authority is seeking a developer for a marina with at
least 60 slips for megayachts.
</P>
<P>
And in the Caribbean's duty-free mecca of St. Maarten, the government expanded
the Simpson Bay Lagoon channel by 20 feet (6 meters) and rebuilt a bridge to
accommodate the Dutch territory's increasing megayacht traffic.
</P>
<P>
Critics say the owners of smaller sailboats will ultimately be squeezed out and
the environment will suffer. But there is little organized opposition.
</P>
<P>
"Anything of any mega-size is obviously a concern in the industry, but it
doesn't seem that anyone has raised any red flags," said Deirdre Shurland,
director of the Puerto Rico-based Caribbean Alliance for Sustainable Tourism, a
hotel-owners group that advocates eco-friendly tourism.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the popularity of megayachts -- for those who can afford them -- is red
hot.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the world had fewer than 700 private owners with boats over 80 feet (24
meters). Today, there are an estimated 7,000 yachts over 80 feet (24 meters) in
use, according to ShowBoats International, a publication that tracks vessel
construction.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Forbes magazine reports there were 793 billionaires last year
-- 317 more than in 2003.
</P>
<P>
"People want to build their own island, their own safe and secure private world.
No better way than aboard a yacht," said Jill Bobrow, editor-in-chief of
ShowBoats International.
</P>
<P>
Americans, the world leaders in big-boat sailing, are largely driving the craze.
But builders say more are emerging from the Middle East, Russia and Eastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Mediterranean megayacht berths outnumber the Caribbean's by 10-to-1, according
to Michael J. Howorth, a British maritime writer and yacht captain. "There's no
place else to build in the Mediterranean and there's a lot of local antipathy to
new marinas."
</P>
<P>
In the Caribbean, megayachtsmen suffer from "an acute shortage of large
megayacht marinas," said British entrepreneur Peter de Savary, a megayacht owner
who is financing the Grenada project.
</P>
<P>
Many in the region's nautical industry, from harbor masters to marine suppliers,
say the bigger-is-better trend has taken them by surprise, but they welcome
it.
</P>
<P>
"It's been great for the economy, so I say 'Long may the megayacht live!'" said
Tom Patterson, manager of the Antigua Yacht Club in English Harbor, Antigua,
which has slips for megayachts. "These people are the wealthiest tourists in the
world."

A German tourist who was arrested with a Frenchman after their boat allegedly
strayed into Iranian waters has been freed from prison in Tehran, Foreign
Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Donald Klein, a 52-year-old sculptor, was arrested by Iran along with Stephane
Lherbier in November 2005 after entering Iran's territorial waters during a
sailing trip off the coast of neighboring United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
The two were convicted in January 2006 and sentenced to 18 months in prison.
Though Iran's Foreign Ministry at the time confirmed that they were tried and
convicted, it gave no other details of their case.
</P>
<P>
When Lherbier was released last month, however, the French Foreign Ministry said
he had been convicted of taking photos of ships in the Persian
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Steinmeier said Klein had been released into the custody of the German Embassy
in Tehran and would be brought home as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
No other details were immediately available.

Asian nations push for more exposure in cruise market
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MIAMI BEACH, Florida 2007-03-15 00:05:16 UTC

<TEXT>
<P>
The Port of Shanghai is getting a new cruise passenger terminal. Southeast Asian
nations are teaming up on a Web site for cruise travelers. Officials from China
are using the 2008 Olympics to promote a triangle of northern cruise
ports.
</P>
<P>
Asia is cruising's new frontier.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the Asia-Pacific region this week began an aggressive
marketing campaign with the goal of making Asia a competitor in the world cruise
market. In town for the Seatrade Cruise Shipping Conference, many toured ports
in Miami and Port Everglades to get a sense of U.S. port operations.
</P>
<P>
"Asia is blooming, maybe because people are too familiar with the south
Caribbean or South America, and you know Europe is too expensive," said Michael
C.Y. Chang, director of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in New York.
"Most of the countries in Asia are in a very good shape and it's reasonable in
cost and it has major wonders and culture."
</P>
<P>
Today, the Asia-Pacific region lags behind the Caribbean, Europe and Alaska as a
cruise destination. But Asian officials say there is long-term growth potential
for a region with improving ports and alluring destinations. They predict that
cruising in the region will grow 40 percent to 1.5 million passengers in
2010.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure is mentioned as a major obstacle for ship and passenger capacity,
with many ports falling short of having adequate transportation in and out of
port facilities. Security, deployment costs and marketing to Asian travelers are
other challenges.
</P>
<P>
The world's largest two cruise operators, Carnival Corp. and Royal Caribbean
Cruises, are establishing a presence in Asia. Carnival Corp.'s Costa Cruises
already offers Asia-Pacific vacations on the Costa Allegra, and Royal
Caribbean's Rhapsody of the Seas will become the largest ship in the region when
it deploys in December. Both ships will target Asia as a source
market.
</P>
<P>
Colin Veitch, president and CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line, a wholly owned
subsidiary of Star Cruises Group, said Star Cruises, which sails in the
Asia-Pacific region, has seen bureaucratic issues related to cruising in China
and a reluctance of Asians to take trips longer than two or three
days.
</P>
<P>
"From listening to what goes on out there, I know Star's operation is somewhat
different, very localized, and is concentrated on very short cruises," Veitch
said. "The Asian domestic market appears to be really quite small in terms of
what we understand of a cruise vacation. My personal view is, I think it's going
to take some time for that to develop."
</P>
<P>
The Port of Shanghai is addressing some infrastructure concerns by investing in
a terminal to hold three 80,000-gross-ton cruise ships and 1 million passengers
per day. Shanghai's busy port already is served by Costa, Princess Cruises and
Holland America Line, which fall under the umbrella of Carnival
Corp.
</P>
<P>
"Cruises are quite new to the Chinese people, so it's important for us to
educate the public about the cruise ship lifestyle," said Chen Xuyuan, president
of the Shanghai International Port Group.
</P>
<P>
The port of Tianjin is billed as the gateway to Beijing, which will host the
2008 Summer Olympics. Two other north China ports, Dalian and Qingdao, are set
to have new cruise terminals within the next three years.
</P>
<P>
China is working closely with Korea and Japan to boost cruise travel in
northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, collaborated on
a Web site to promote the Southeast Asian cruise industry, which is predicted to
grow 5 percent per year until 2020, to about 820,000 passengers. The site
directs users to a site for each ASEAN country and gives executives access to
port information.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN Cruise Working Group also plans to train travel agents on cruising,
pursue infrastructure development and build relationships with the cruise
industry, said chairman Kevin Leong.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan had just 24,000 cruise passengers last year and does not have direct
sailings to China because of political issues. However, it would like to
increase its exposure to cruise passengers by targeting source markets of the
United States, Japan, Hong Kong and Macau, said Kuo Su Tsan-Yang, deputy general
of Taiwan Tourism Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Another company in the region is Seabourn Cruise Line, which services ports in
Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam and elsewhere. Peter Cox, Seabourn's director of
itinerary planning and development, cites security as a concern for cruise lines
looking at the Asia-Pacific market.
</P>
<P>
Bombings in Bali and incidents in the Philippines have led Seabourn to stop
sailing to Indonesia and the Philippines for now.
</P>
<P>
That said, there is "tremendous" potential for growth in Asia, but not right
away, Cox said.

<P>
Panamanian police seized a boat off the nation's Pacific coast carrying 19.4
metric tons (21.4 tons) of cocaine in one of the biggest maritime cocaine busts
on record, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
National police working with agents from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency seized
the boat on Sunday near the island of Coiba, said a police official who asked
his name not be used because he was not authorized to speak on the
record.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested 12 men on the boat, including Mexicans and Panamanians, and
another two suspects in Panama City in connection with the drugs, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
The boat, which was sailing under a Panamanian flag, was being transported to
Panama City on Monday, he said.
</P>
<P>
Drug cartels often smuggle Colombian cocaine along Panama's Pacific coast en
route to the United States.

Global warming and new technology heat up race for riches in melting Arctic
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HAMMERFEST, Norway 2007-03-23 00:36:40 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Barren and uninhabited, Hans Island is very hard to find on a
map.
</P>
<P>
Yet these days the Frisbee-shaped rock in the Arctic is much in demand -- so much
so that Canada and Denmark have both staked their claim to it with flags and
warships.
</P>
<P>
The reason: an international race for oil, fish, diamonds and shipping routes,
accelerated by the impact of global warming on Earth's frozen
north.
</P>
<P>
The latest report by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says the
ice cap is warming faster than the rest of the planet and ice is receding,
partly due to greenhouse gases. It's a catastrophic scenario for the Arctic
ecosystem, for polar bears and other wildlife, and for Inuit populations whose
ancient cultures depend on frozen waters.
</P>
<P>
But some see a lucrative silver lining of riches waiting to be snatched from the
deep, and the prospect of timesaving sea lanes that could transform the shipping
industry the way the Suez Canal did in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Geological Survey estimates the Arctic has as much as 25 percent of the
world's undiscovered oil and gas. Moscow reportedly sees the potential of
minerals in its slice of the Arctic sector approaching US$2 trillion (euro1.5
trillion).
</P>
<P>
All this has pushed governments and businesses into a scramble for sovereignty
over these suddenly priceless seas.
</P>
<P>
Regardless of climate change, oil and gas exploration in the Arctic is moving
full speed ahead. State-controlled Norwegian oil company Statoil ASA plans to
start tapping gas from its offshore Snoehvit field in December, the first in the
Barents Sea. It uses advanced equipment on the ocean floor, remote-controlled
from the Norwegian oil boom town of Hammerfest through a 90-mile (145-kilometer)
undersea cable.
</P>
<P>
Alan Murray, an analyst with the energy consultants Wood Mackenzie, said most
petroleum companies are now focusing research and exploration on the far north.
Russia is developing the vast Shkotman natural gas field off its Arctic coast,
and Norwegians hope their advanced technology will find a place
there.
</P>
<P>
"Oil will bring a big geopolitical focus. It is a driving force in the Arctic,"
said Arvid Jensen, a consultant in Hammerfest who advises companies that hope to
hitch their economic wagons to the northern rush.
</P>
<P>
It could open the North Pole region to easy navigation for five months a year,
according to the latest Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, an intergovernmental
group. That could cut sailing time from Germany to Alaska by 60 percent, going
through Russia's Arctic instead of the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
Or the Northwest Passage could open through the channels of Canada's Arctic
islands and shorten the voyage from Europe to the Far East. And that's where
Hans Island, at the entrance to the Northwest Passage, starts to
matter.
</P>
<P>
The half-square-mile (1.3-square-kilometer) rock, just one-seventh the size of
New York's Central Park, is wedged between Canada's Ellesmere Island and
Danish-ruled Greenland, and for more than 20 years has been a subject of
unusually bitter exchanges between the two NATO allies.
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Denmark's minister for Greenland affairs, Tom Hoeyem, caused a stir
when he flew in on a chartered helicopter, raised a Danish flag on the island,
buried a bottle of brandy at the base of the flagpole and left a note saying:
"Welcome to the Danish island."
</P>
<P>
The dispute erupted again two years ago when Canadian Defense Minister Bill
Graham set foot on the rock while Canadian troops hoisted the Maple Leaf
flag.
</P>
<P>
Denmark sent a letter of protest to Ottawa, while Canadians and Danes took out
competing Google ads, each proclaiming sovereignty over the rock 680 miles
(1,100 kilometers) south of the North Pole.
</P>
<P>
Some Canadians even called for a boycott of Danish pastries.
</P>
<P>
Although both countries have repeatedly sent warships to the island to make
their presence felt, there's no risk of a shooting war -- both sides are resolved
to settle the problem peacefully. But the prospect of a warmer planet opening up
the icy waters has helped push the issue up the agenda.
</P>
<P>
"We all realize that because of global warming it will suddenly be an area that
will become more accessible," said Peter Taksoe-Jensen, head of the Danish
Foreign Ministry's legal department.
</P>
<P>
Shortcuts through Arctic waters are no longer the stuff of science
fiction.
</P>
<P>
In August 2005, the Akademik Fyodorov of Russia was the first ship to reach the
North Pole without icebreaker help. The Norwegian shipyard Aker Yards is
building innovative vessels that sail forward in clear waters, and then turn
around to plow with their sterns through heavier ice.
</P>
<P>
Global warming is also bringing an unexpected bonus to American transportation
company OmniTrax Inc., which a decade ago bought the small underutilized
Northwest Passage port of Churchill, Manitoba, for a token fee of 10 Canadian
dollars (about US$8;euro6).
</P>
<P>
The company, which is private, won't say how much money it is making in
Churchill, but it was estimated to have moved more than 500,000 tons of grain
through the port in 2007.
</P>
<P>
Managing director Michael Ogborn said climate change was not something the
company thought about in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"But over the last 10 years we saw a lengthening of the season, which appears to
be related to global warming," Ogborn said. "We see the trend
continuing."
</P>
<P>
Just a few years ago, reports said it would take 100 years for the ice to melt,
but recent studies say it could happen in 10-15 years, and the United States,
Canada, Russia, Denmark and Norway have been rushing to stake their claims in
the Arctic.
</P>
<P>
Norway and Russia have issues in the Barents Sea; the U.S. and Russia in
Beaufort Sea; the U.S. and Canada over rights to the Northwest Passage; and even
Alaska and Canada's Yukon province over their offshore boundary.
</P>
<P>
Canada, Russia and Denmark are seeking to claim waters all the way up to the
North Pole, saying the seabed is part of their continental shelf under the 1982
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Norway wants to extend its
claims on the same basis, although not all the way to the pole.
</P>
<P>
Canada says the Northwest Passage is its territory, a claim the United States
hotly disputes, insisting the waters are neutral. Canadian Prime Minister
Stephen Harper has pledged to put military icebreakers in the frigid waters "to
assert our sovereignty and take action to protect our territorial
integrity."
</P>
<P>
Politics aside, there are environmental concerns. Apart from the risk of oil
spills, more vessels could carry alien organisms into the Northwest Passage,
posing a risk to indigenous life forms.
</P>
<P>
The Arctic melt has also been intensifying competition over dwindling fishing
stocks.
</P>
<P>
Fish stocks essential to some regions appear to be moving to colder waters, and
thus into another country's fishing grounds. Russian and Norwegian fishermen
already report catching salmon much farther north than is normal.
</P>
<P>
"It is potentially very dramatic for fish stocks. They could move toward the
North Pole, which would make sovereignty very unclear," said Dag Vongraven, an
environmental expert at the Norwegian Polar Institute.
</P>
<P>
Russia contests Norway's claims to fish-rich waters around the Arctic Svalbard
Islands, and has even sent warships there to underscore its discontent with the
Norwegian Coast Guard boarding Russian trawlers there.
</P>
<P>
"Even though they say it is about fish, it is really about oil," said Jensen,
the consultant in Hammerfest.
</P>
<P>
In 2004, Russian President Vladimir Putin called the sovereignty issue "a
serious, competitive battle" that "will unfold more and more
fiercely."
</P>
<P>
With all the squabbling over ownership, Tristan Pearce, a research associate at
the University of Guelph's Global Environmental Change Group in Canada, reminded
Arctic nations of who got there first: indigenous peoples like the Inuits and
the Sami.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is talking about the potential for minerals, diamonds, oil and gas,
but we mustn't forget that people live there, all the way across the Arctic," he
said. "They've always been there and they have a major role to
play."

Italian patrol ship intercepts boat full of migrants off Senegal ' s coast

<P>
An Italian coast guard vessel intercepted a merchant ship carrying 350 suspected
illegal migrants off Senegal's coast, Italian authorities said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Italian coast guard officials intercepted the 52-meter (170-foot-) long
North Korean-flagged ship on Thursday evening at the request of Spanish
authorities, said Capt. Cristiano Aliperto, a coast guard spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The Italian ship is part of a European Union patrol of the waters off Africa's
west coast in a bid to stem illegal immigration. Last year, more than 30,000
immigrants, mostly sub-Saharan Africans, were intercepted while trying to reach
Spain's Canary Islands last year, after sailing from west Africa in crowded
boats.
</P>
<P>
Authorities believe that the ship intercepted by the Italians about 80 miles
(125 kilometers) north of Dakar was headed toward the Canaries, Aliperta said.
Most of the passengers were from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, along with a
few Nigerians, the captain said. They were in good condition.
</P>
<P>
The ship was being escorted by the Italian coast guard vessel and was expected
to arrive in Dakar's port later on Friday, Aliperta said.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the crew of six Georgians risked being charged with
trafficking in human beings.
